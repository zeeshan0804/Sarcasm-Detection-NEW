would this be considered intelligent design? to me it would be like winding up a top, loading it with paint, and then letting it spin on paper to create a painting. the process is deliberately set in motion, but the painting itself is random and not deliberate. where the paint falls is not by design, even though the overall pattern would be.   anyway, to answer the question, there are lots of people who believe in a creator as well as evlution, so the beliefs are not mutually exclusive. the problem is that christianity depends upon the account of genesis being true. spontaneous origin is mutually exclusive to genesis, but evolution by itself is not necessarily. but evolution poses other problems such as the age of the earth and the existence of dinosaurs that creationists are stumped by.   in order to belief in evolution, you must, at the very least, disregard the genesis account. and disregarding genesis automatically invalidates christianity. but it doesnt necessarily invalidate the existence of a creator. pretty wierd, huh?	0
Because when something passes every experiment thrown at it and when something fits observation better than anything else, then it's as near as damnit fact. We can get pedantic over this if you want, but the conclusion that reaches is that there are no facts.	0
Now you are being insulting. Evolution makes no statments about your god. For that matter, neither does cosmology, astronomy, chemistry, physics or geology.	1
It is clearly not a strawman argument. I think he doesn't know what "straw man" means and I think he is meaning to say "red herring."   It isn't a red herring either; it's a perfectly logically related question. I would guess he doesn't see that as he neither understands evolution nor bacterial resistance and, thus, the relationship.	0

To Clive14:   Darwin never produced a "Theory of Human Evolution".   R--i--g--h--t. And I'm a Shakespearean act--o--r. Darwin's book titled "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life" sure seems to me to suggest that he had an idea on the evolution of man. Darwinian evolution was (and still is) inherently a racist philosophy, teaching that different groups or "races" of people evolved at different times and rates, so some groups are more like their ape-like ancestors than others. Darwin believed, for instance, that the Australian Aboriginals were considered the missing links between an ape-like ancestor and the rest of mankind". Many indigenous peoples died because of Darwinian evolution, so don't give me such rubbish that Darwin never did a theory of human evolution.   Darwin's evolutionary scheme went something like this:   Evolutionary ancestor --> Australoid --> Negroid --> Mongoloid --> Caucasoid.   Perhaps you best go home and check up on your own theory before you post such a remark. And people think that creationists are mis-informed!   This is true of the unscientific use of the word "theory". In science, "theory" is equivalent to "fact". There is a theory of gravity for example. Is gravity just guesswork therefore?   Once again, falsehood. If a theory is equivalent to fact, than why do they have two different things. In science, using you above example, gravity is a fact (I don't think that there is a theory of gravity, at least it is not in the HSC Physics course when we were studying it!). By definition, a theory is an explanation of observed facts and laws. It is supported by experiments upon which it is based, and is confirmed by experiments designed to test predictions based on the explanation. Now where in that definition is the word fact either used or implied? Now where, a theory is like a story to explain observed facts and phenomenon. A theory does not mean the idea is "fact". It is just a story used to explain how some observed phenomenon may have either came into existence, or why and how it behaves the way it does. You mis-interpretation of scientific terms is noted.   I disagree. Faith is believing something to be true regardless of the evidence. People have faith in the Bible. People do not (or should not) have faith in evolution.   I agree with your definition of faith. Bible believing creationists must take it by faith that there is a God, and that the Bible is the Inspired Word of God. Evolutionists (for the most part, i.e. most are atheistic), however, must take it by blind faith that there is no God and that the Bible is not the Inspired Word of God.   Your last sentence struck me as to how brainwashed some (or many people) are in the lie of evolution (microorganism into people evolution). For one, evolutionists must take it by blind faith that stuff has evolved, i.e. there is very few fossils that support this notion. The fossil record dismisses and is a crushing critque of Darwinian evolution. For example, Dr Ronald R. West (paleoecology and geology) stated in his article "Paleoecology and uniformitarianism" which was published in Compass, vol.45, May 1968, p. 216:   "Contrary to what most scientists write, the fossil record does not support the Darwinian theory of evolution [microorganism to man] because it is this theory (there are several) which we use to interpret the fossil record. By doing so we are guilty of circular reasoning if we then say the fossil record supports this theory."   In addition to this, Dr David B. Kitts (School of Geology and Geophysics, Department of History of Science) in his article "Paleontology and evolutionary theory" in Evolution, vol. 28, September 1974, p. 467 says the following:   "Despite the bright promise that paleonotlogy provides a means of "seeing" evolution, it has presented some nasty difficulties for evolutionists the most notorious of which is the presence of "gaps" in the fossil record. Evolution requires intermediate forms between species and paleontology does not provide them. The gaps must therefore be a contingent feature of the record."   What they are saying is that the fossil record does not show evolution, but we will continue to believe it even though we have no proof of the theory of evolution (i.e. microorganism to man evolution).   Evolution has been proven. Creation has been disproven. This whole argument is over stubbornness on the part of people with faith who cannot bring themselves to accept that evolution has been proven and creation has been disproven.   Four words that always gets an evolutionist into trouble, "Evolution has been proven". If you refer to what you call "micro-evolution" (to which creationists call "Varriation within a "kind"") than I would agree with you. Species change all of the time, but it is important to know that the species never get more complex, they are constantly losing gentic information (i.e. DNA) and becoming less complex. With natural selection, things lose an ability that will enable a species to survive in an environment (usually by the way of mutations). So since varriation within a kind (or micro-evolution - always a loss of DNA) has been proved, this is also further evidence to the creationary model. The macro-evolution has not been proven. Nor does the fossil record bear out many evidences for this, as many leading evolutionary scientists have (or are comming) to realise.   Creation has not been disproven, as you falsely claim. Otherwise, the evolutionists here on this forum would be able to hammer the creationist arguments, and thus far they have not. This fact alone is evidence against you. They only gain an advantage when we start having silly debates on things that I do not know much on, nor have studied up on, such as geological features for an example. We have the same rocks, so of course the evolutionists are going to claim that in many cases I am wrong - as they have a different interpretation to me. Or they have a different story to explain who a land structure got there to me. Both stories are based on the evidence, so it is hard to get through to one another. Sadly, time restricts me from continuing.	1

Wrong again sherlock. All of this animosity is after the fact to why radical islam considers our christian Nation to be hypocritical due to the exporting of our pop culture of hedonistic sexual and moral depravity. That was why they signed fatwas against us originally. It is the abortions, gay marriage and our women walking around half naked that caused that lack of respect to occur. And you can thank the immoral left for that contribution to Americas image. It was the Left that coined the phrase, "If it feels good, do it," Not the Right.	1
Really? Then why did you start off your little rant by admitting that "...microevolution cannot be reasonably disputed." Evolution has been observed, and that is a fact. Speciation in both plants and animals has been observed, and that is a fact. Apparently you don't know what a theory is. Might it not be wise to learn just a little about science before you make yourself look so foolish? Theories explain facts.	1
I'm now slightly less confused about why I've never seen this discussed before.	1
well that won't help you when you go to hell...Woo hoo	1
Everything basically.   You're held captive by hostile natives that have set up barricades and checkpoints around the property you live on.

Maybe you'll have to clear up the difference between "understanding" and "knowing." I know what I think the difference is, but I need to know what you mean when you say "I understand that there is definitely no god."   Personally, I understand that we have no verification one way or another.   All I know is that I don't know one way or the other.	0
I would say that the soul is that part of us that is immortal. It is our essence. Our personality may impact or is impacted by it, but I would say it is far more. Indeed, I would say it is what psychologists call emergent downward causality.   As for the role of God, science has not disproven any of it. Science has explained how things occur but that does not eliminate the possibility of god nor does it limit what god does. We would simply not be understanding gods fit in the science of it. That makes sense given that god is considered infinite and we are finite. I think the soul is what gives us the possibility of even imagining the infinite. The idea that we can see beyond what we are or even to conceptualize such things gives a clue that there is more to us than meets the eye.   I do not see why God and science cannot coexist. Even evolution and creation. Forget planting evidence. That is too far fetched. I would rather think that it is more likely that what God says actually fits the evidence even though we cannot understand it. I do not know about God or "not god" (if you will) but if there is a God then the idea that he is beyond what I can actually conceive and yet completely conceivable makes sense for that kind of being. It should be an apparent paradox to me. If it is not, then my concept of God is faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr to small to be of any use to anyone.   Huck.	0

Wow! You really have been paying attention to the Democratic smear campaign of the healthcare insurance industry, haven&#8217;t you? Did you also pay attention to their relative profit margins VS those of other industries? It was 2.2% ROI!!! Banks make 10X that much and I don&#8217;t hear your demagoguery directed at them. In fact over 35 other industries make higher profits than health insurance companies.   Try doing some of your own research for a change and stop listening to DNC brainwashing. If they spent Â½ of the time that they spend railing against the current healthcare insurance companies on something more pertinent, like shutting off the unlimited money supply to banks, this country would be able to pay for our, and probably Canada&#8217;s, healthcare.	1

The Brady Campaign whines more than they act. Making handguns legal in Chicago wouldn't make them happy. Sending the national guard in wouldn't make them happy.

Well right there, you used an oxymoron, "Great" and "Evangelist" got together about as well as Military Inteligence.   Secondly, as I stated before...you left too many other questions unanswered about the "Preacher."	0
Nobody I know sanctions adultery. There are already serious consequences built in against it. As far a same sex marriage, I know of nobody that is suggesting legal penalties for it unless one considers the refusal to legally recognize it a legal penalty. Certainly nobody has been jailed or fined for attempting such marriages. Privately performed ceremonies as such are not punished.	0
Then should not your challenge be re-worded to say "What might be the best..."   Because at present we are not at a stage where by we know everything about 'pain' therefore in the current climate, rather than what might be known down the track, I think I have met the majority of your challenge. After-all, you are insisting now on what 'you can measure', and we can't measure all that there is about pain, at present.	0

BWAHAHAHAHHAAH!   Innocent citizens are FIVE TIMES more likely to be mistakenly shot by a cop, than a cop even DELIBERATELY by a civilian!   Likewise, if my life is in danger, then I'm not really too worried about my lack of accountability to the person choosing to ENDANGER it; and I'm really sure if he's willling to commit armed murder then he's not too worried about misdemeanor gun-laws.   Psht, it's amazing how stupid, naive and arrogant these anti-gun XXXXXX are.   It's easy to get cute when someone ELSE'S life is on the line, but it's just plain evil to use the guns of the state, to take away someone ELSE'S guns and expose them to danger-- and particularly cowardly and hyopcrticial while cringing behind a safe neighborhood and lifestyle, while hiding from potential danger-- than shamelessly attacking those who simply fight BACK.	0

Obviously not. If the right to life trumps all other rights, then it follows that the mother's right to life and the child's right to life cancel each other out.   Mind you, if it's her choice then the pro-life movement endorses such heroism, right?	0
Well try Arkansas (75/25), Georgia (76/24), Kentucky (75/25), Michigan (59/41), Mississippi (86/14), Montana (67/33), North Dakota (73/27), Ohio (62/38), Oklahoma (76/24), Oregon (57/43), and Utah (66/34).   All of these margins were well above the percentage of votes cast for Bush and Kerry, respectively. Ohio, for instance, went to Bush by 2%, but the ban was passed by 24%. Bush lost Oregon by 4%, but the ban passed by 14%. Bush lost Michigan by 3%, but the ban passed by 18%. The margin of victory for each of these states exceeds George Bush's margin of victory in that state. Those extra votes had to come from somewhere, and it seems like many people other than the "religious right" feel the same way.	0

NOt true,   California's ammendments are not doing as well as other states did. You are talking about a very liberal state.

Actually, I think Kronos is right in this case--at least from the standpoint of most consitutional scholars. Of course the framers didn't envision the wording to be used in this way for this purpose--this is what's simply called a "loophole", in this case anyway. It's why there has been an effort in recent years to close the loophole with a constitutional amendment defining marriage.	0

Really! Then I assume that you have read Darwin - at least On the Origin of Species. Otherwise you are babbling.

No, not really...	0
I think you fail to take into account that for most opposers of abortion, they genuinely feel they are trying to save lives by their opposition. In many cases it's not a matter of trying control sexual prermissiveness in society but preventing lives from being killed. Disagree or not, you can't separate the anti-abortion message from the fact that it holds to the view that abortion is a form of murder.	0
You know, I'd believe that more if there were people like the Shindler family who have pushed for federal courts to intervene and destroy the sanctity of marriage. There is nothing you could do or say that would convince me that Americans somehow have any respect for marriage whatsoever. What heterosexuals have done to destroy this institution from the inside out only tells me that heteros are simply spoiled children who have the attitude of:   "If we can't make it work, we aren't going to allow anyone else to come in and do marriage better."	1
Yes, and since some might not, it should not be mentioned at all?   Personally I only know a half dozen people who have had abortions (at least that I know if). 1 of them doesn't care, she has had 6 or 8 abortions...pretty much used them instead of the pill. 2 are pro life zealots now and feel terrible about the fact they had aboortions. 2 are pro life, but not zealots. The final one was overwhelming pro choice prior to her abortion. Attended rallies and everything. SHE felt so bad about havinghte abortion afterwards that 6 months later she blew her head off. She could not get it out of her head that she had killed a baby. She became totally obsessed and finally cracked.   So, yea...maybe it is not so out of line for people, including men, to say "Think about it real hard because a lot of people regret it". You don't have to get shot to know it hurts.	1
Right. It's called stasis. Species that are well adapted to their environments tend to change little in a stable environment. It is still true that fossil crocs are not the same as modern crocs. There are obvious differences.	0

Then you freely admit that you lied when you said this, and I quote: People like Arch are setting it as opposed to science and in that position it will be doomed to fail.   AND   Arch is doing nothing but distorting the very thing he holds so dear, I mean, how is accurately quoting passages from the bible distorting it in any way? You do nothing but post drivel which makes no factual statements at all. And you call that debating?	0
You still don't get it. How many times does it have to be explained to you? Populations evolve. No change of any kind in a single organism is evolution. Evolution is the changes in the hereditary (genetic) makeup of populations over time.   You continue to display your ignorance. Evolution is a process that takes place in living things. Just because all of science contradicts your childish belief in mythology doesn't mean that all science is evolution. Because cosmology contradicts your mythology, it must be evolution. Because astronomy contradicts your mythology, it must be evolution. Because geology contradicts your mythology, it must be evolution.   And that is why creationists are such scary people. Their morality comes from a book and threats of eternal punishment. The fundamentalist christian morality is so shallow that they are unable to conceive that others can actually have a higher morality based on self respect.   And that is meaningless babble. Evolution is a process that has been observed whether you like it or not. It is not a moral statement nor is it a statement of faith. It does not deal with government, laws or culture. Whining about it won't change it.	0
I never said anything about a conspiracy Peeling. I very clearly gave valid reasons to Consider that scientific GRANTS and pay increases for these scientists are based on making new and previously undiscovered claims that forward the science.

Give me three good reasons why a thirteen year old girl from Plam Beach, that are practial not religous please, should not have an abortion and I will promise not to make fun of you. Much.   Judges do this everyday. This case just made the news.	1

You twisted logic strikes again. I realise that if a group of you were to take your guns and rise up against the current administration, you would all be labelled terrorists. This is not evidence that I support the current regime. How you could twist it to seem so is beyond me.   If I were to state that you couldn't take on a fully grown polar bear with just a short pointy stick, would that mean I am supporting the oppressive rule of polar bears? I think you should sit down and carefully think out what you infer from other's arguments before you keep coming out with these ludicrous statements.	0

I know this is an old posting, but I thought I would add to it. I have built several 1911 clones. Press forge the frame (and slide, sometimes), then mill the parts. I use a CNC mill (about $750,000). A lot fo guys, though, use a $300 minimill from harbor freight. A setup for press forging the parts (press forging is the better modern alternative to drop forging) will set you back less than $200, if you are a good scrounger.   Gun building is probably a more common hobby than you might think. It is hard to tell exactly how many people are doing it, because a homebuilt gun requires no registration, permit to build, or any of that other XXXX (unless you are building an NFA firearm, which is a machine gun). There is even a yahoo group about building your own gun. Fro the faint of heart (those who don't want to forge or cast theri own reciver/frame) there are a bunch of places that will sell you an 80% finished reciever, which doesn't count as a firearm from a legal viewpoint.   I always buy my barrels since it is too much work to do the rifling. In a pinch, it could be done, it just wouldn't be a competition grade barrel. Of course, most firearms you buy don't come with a stock competition grade barrel.	0
well if you think the sun goes around the earth then its time for apocalypse.	1
Really, then show me how I'm wrong - without dogmatic statements. I would suggest, given the fact that you feel the need to ignore science, deny obvious facts of reason, and cling to evolutionary theory, that it is you that has the problem with religion - your naturalistic religion. I would further suggest that you stop attibuting your personal opinions to science, and start calling your comments what they really are, personal opinion.   -By the way, is everyone who disagrees with you promoting a "religious agenda?" Where have I leaned on religion to make my point? And what makes you think that I need religion to defeat your postion as I have here? I've used science, scientific journals, and good sound reasoning to defeat your comments. I suggest you rethink what you're saying. It sure sounds like you're the one with the "religious agenda."	0

the reason why premise 1 can logically stand is that God is first of all defined as the "greatest possible being". no matter what reality we are considering, such a thing as the greatest possible being in that relity must exist. "greatest" is a superlative, compared to all other beings that exist   its like "the oldest man alive". no matter what scenario, such a person as the oldest man alive will always exist, therefore such a man (that fits that definition) will have a necessary existence	0
Actually they do. Whether or not you think they should is another matter entirely. Did you not notice where the article came from? From a paper in India.

Banning abortion is a tool with which to punish women you deem promiscuous or immoral and recreate through a police state a mythical golden age of christian virtue, got you.

But let me guess ... if they step down RIGHT after they find they will have to issue to gay couples, you'd be in favor of them being able to be sued for it, simply because the "discrimination" in such an event was toward gays?

Anyway, aside from that inconsistency with your position elsewhere, I agree that county officials should need to comply. After all, there are probably OTHER examples whereby county officials have to do things that they are religiously against, such as issue divorce papers. Or marry some drunk couple that they know aren't really being serious even though they're tying the knot ... If all county officials could just refuse to do their job because of their objections--for WHATEVER reasons--it would be a collosal mess.	0
And you can be described as a "pre-dead corpse" as well. Histrionic revisionist linguistics only serve to push some form of dishonesty agenda that can not stand by itself on the facts. It is the coward's route. Are you a coward???   Golly gee. Scared already?   Ah, so the dictionary is the ultimate authority? And all the way down to the 5th definition no less?

I think I, and the other members of what I'll call the "scientific community", must be masochists of sorts as well, we continually return to these threads and bang our heads against minds that are stone walls - completely impervious to reason or logic.   I think, no, I know, that there are two main reasons why I return to these threads. The first one is simple, I'm amazed at the scientific illiteracy of the average YEC, especially when science is often their justification for belief.   The second and major reason is simply my fascination with how the mind of the Creationist works. Their desperation to justify their faith is so powerful it drives them to completely abandon mainstream science and logic in favour of an isolated coccoon of reality. The insecurity in their faith that the entire pseudoscience of creationism betrays is the most ironic part.   As you say, most quickly realize that they're in over their heads, that what they've been told in their churches doesn't stand up to scrutiny in the real world. So, rather than continuing down a path that will bring them no good, they retreat and bury their heads in the comforting sand of "not knowing any better". However, there always seems to be one or two that are so deeply entrenched, that they simply can't retreat, they've got too much invested.   The psychology, more than the science, is fascinating to me.   Waxy	0

First, I think you may have misunderstood the "pro-life mantra" seeing how many pro-lifers think it permissable to disconnect life-support systems in certain circumstances, which necessarily results in a person's death. But nevertheless, I think we agree that for purposes of the abortion discussion, it is a closer analogy to assume the violinst is only connected for nine months, and no longer than if we assume the violinist to be connected for some other arbitrary period of time. Am I correctly discerning an agreement on that?	0
Blah, blah, blah.   Stop throwing out discredited and biased stories. Explain in your own terms, exactly how having a gun makes you more likely to be shot. Explain the mechanics of how this works. Go on and try, make some sense rather than cherry picking poorly executed "studies" that prove nothing.   You made the claim that if you have a gun in your possession, this fact magnifies your chances of somehow being shot. What you suggest can only happen if magic somehow exists, like the legally-owned guns sends out powerful magnetic waves to attract the criminals and hypnotizes them to shoot in a situation that they normally wouldn't shoot.	1

Just helping something live doesn't affect evolution unless it affects the ability to reproduce viable offspring.   If there was no nylon before the 1940s and there is an organism that can survive by eating NOTHING else, what does that tell you? There could not have been a population of nylon-eating bacteria before 1940. This is a new population that did not exist before.	1
so why is population control a good arguement for abortion? Why don't we kill old people too...	1

Really? A lot of people say that every answer makes more questions. In some ways we seem to know less now than we did at the time of Newton, in that we are less certain.   And Newton's laws deal with what happens in a vacuum with no resistance, not direct human experience   At any rate, my point is that you can't see all the evidence as piling up support for 'science' as 'science' is moulded to fit that evidence. Not a criticism of science, btw.	0
Because of the rare nature of fossilisation, we don't expect to see perfect transitional lineages through millions and millions of years. I really don't think there are any scientists that think there SHOULD be millions and millions of transitions, because of the nature of fossilisation.   Science is like a detective story. If you wanted to solve a murder, for example, you take a look at the evidence. You have a gun, spent rounds, dead body etc. To convict someone of a murder, you need fingerprints, blood on clothes, DNA and such to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person you are accusing actually shot the deceased and you can convict WITHOUT an eye witness.   It's the same for science and the fossil record, because there is no-one around who directly observed animals undertaking large changes over time. But if you take a look at the fossil record, molecular biology, geological time etc, this is what it shows. From what we understand from the last 100 or so years of evidence and investigation, biological evolution is the best scientific explanation we have for the diversity of life on earth.   3 questions for Calligirl.   For the 4th time. What would be YOUR definition of a transitional form?   When calculating the age of this earth, how precise do you expect or want scientists to get?   How many transitional fossils would you LIKE to see in what period of time?   I really don't think this will progress if you can't tell us what it is you would like to see.	0

No I don't think that tying your tubes is abortion. I only think abortion comes into play when there is actually cells forming to make a baby, and you get them scraped out, or abort a baby before or after the third trimester. Plus I heard that if you tie the tubes, when you decide you want a baby you can untie the tubes, to conceive a baby. But burning is another thing. But unless there is actual cells forming it is not abortion	0
They do not hate the concept, they merely reject it as being useful or necessary to explain the material universe. I mean come on what utility would a physics which incorporated miracles be? Nothing would be predictable and all utility would be lost. If you want all of science to be arbitrary and unreliable then all ya gotta do is inject miracles into the field.   For example what value is f=ma {except when the diety wills otherwise}.   Or e=mc2 (god willing)	0
Well, let's see.   1 This is a skull from a modern human, the differences representing pathological deformities.   2 The dating is based on disputed methodology. Creation scientists have proved that radioisotope dating is unreliable.   3 The two pieces are only assumed to be from the same individual.   4 Where's the conclusive DNA evidence? (A nod to easyrider on the Religion board.)   5 These claims are made by scientists, and all science is an atheistic conspiracy against religion (thank you marc9000).   6 So where's the missing link between the new fossil and us?

Way to miss the entire point, Clerisian.   My point was that is it a horrible experience for many women, and that I wish we could strive towards a society where abortions were no longer needed.

I can't imagine that anyone would disagree with that.	1

I do not argue so much the quality of llife of an individual woman but more for the quality of life, indeed of having access to life itself, of the children of the woman involved, because in many situations the concern and nurturance of a mother may be the only thing keeping children alive, especially in poor, war-torn nations that do not enjoy the relative wealth of the United States.	0
It's NOT any of my business, but when presenting information to the readers at large, such topics need to be ####ing addressed, something militant pro-abortionist seldom want to bring up.

We're dealing with health aspects, all, not just selective. And there may even be things I'm not aware about to consider.	0
Sure. The outcome of Heller vs DC and Florida Shall - Issue laws support that statement. According to Brady logic, the more helpless you are, the safer you are from criminals.	0
The point is that these laws against cheaply manufactured handguns are no more than economic restrictions on gun ownership. This is similar to old english laws which established actual economic requirements for owning weapons. Gun accidents happening due only to poor construction are rare. This is just another form of people control, keeping weapons out of the hands of the poor so as to lessen their importance in politics. "Screw them, they can't do anything about it."	1

Some interesting information, that website where you got your link from, "Reasons To Believe" (RTB) is not a creationist organisation. It is run by compromising Christians, such as Dr Hugh Ross. Answers in Genesis have got quite a lot of information on him and as a result have even more rebuttals to his arguments. Here are several links:   http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/4149.asp   http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/4128.asp   I did notice, however, that the RIB article was written in the year 1999. This is most pecular, because the AiG article in which Dr Russell Humphreys defends himself is written in the year 2000. The following link is a very brief summary of how Dr Humphreys defended himself and his new Relativistic Cosmology from compromising Christians and evolutionists:   http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs...10-10-2000.asp   The following link is where Dr Russell Humphreys defends himself. It shows both the arguments and his rebuttals:   http://www.trueorigin.org/ca_rh_03.asp   I would strongly suggest that you read it.   I can definitely see how you may doubt Dr Humphreys new Cosmology, that was a pretty heavy attack, the much of it went zip, right over my head. But I just can't help but feel that they mis-interpreted several lines and are using some straw man attacks. I personally cannot see anything wrong with his arguments, although if there is, he has given way for a new area of cosmology, a Creationist Cosmology.   I hope that this helps clear up this little problem regarding "Starlight and Time". Got to go,   Matt.	1
Ditto squared. If they support killing a perfectly healthy unborn child, they will argue that the reason stated in the Op is the main reason Abortion is needed and justified. And I must say that if 98% of all abortions were performed for that reason, the public stance against them might not be so strong.	0
Well, if burglars want to steal guns then it makes sense that they would be likely to target the homes of gun owners. And the source is from the recently published book Evaluating Gun Policy which you can read and review. The source is listed at the bottom.	0
I believe abortion is murder and should be illegal. The only possible circumstance when an abortion should be an option is when the “LIFE” of both the mother and her unborn child is at risk. When both lives are going to be lost, it is better to save one as opposed to losing two. The holocaust on the unborn children of this country is something that we should be ashamed of as a country.	0
Well, j, the blah blah blah part was pretty important.   It said, "Seife is referring to how information continues to exist in some form after it has been violently altered; the smoke from a burning newspaper contains data about the newspaper's content, albeit impossible to reconstruct, and even black holes seem not to truly eradicate the information in the matter they consume. All of which has nothing to do with Dembski's claim..." which is true. One definition has nothing to do with the other. Blah blah blah.   http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/903	1

Like the docking simulation, in development there is a pre-existing fitness landscape (the womb).

Actually, natural selection tends to preserve a species with only minor changes in a stable environment. But environments tend to change. I don't know what that "incipient organ" junk is supposed to mean. Is that another way of saying "what good is half a wing." Well, check out a penguin to find out. Look at a seal flipper. It has the same bones, arranged in the same way as a monkey. What good is it for a land animal? And what does "fully functional" mean? What function? Perhaps the new organ had a different purpose - take the clawed hands of fossil birds for example. They were good for catching prey and climbing, just like they were for their dinosaur ancestors. But those clawed wings also allowed early birds to fly.	0
Well let me say that so far that you haven't been doing a very good job. My arguments are completely solid, and you haven't even gotten close to refuting them. You accuse me of being stupid because my mom watched star trek, you refute my arguments by providing the defonition of masturbation and periods, and then you call me illogical and tell me to think about my statements more deeply.   [quote]You said that you can only abort in the first and second trimester, which I already know. But saying that you don't exsist in these stages is a huge misstatement.[quote]   Let me rephrase that. The beginnings of my body existed.

Armour piercing ammo, 100% legal. Here is where you can buy SS109 armour piercing ammo: http://ammoman.com/   I agree, the Brady Bill is laughable to criminals who want the contraban items. You do not even have to buy them, you can make them yourself.   I agree that the cops are not the best protection. The best protection is YOU for YOURSELF. Only you are on the spot the quickest when you are threatened. Only you are able the judge quickest weather your saftey is threatened. Seach on any engine: police accidental shooting. It is quite alarming how many times cops shoot the innocent. If cops can get to a crime scene in time, they have to sort out the criminal and the victim very quickly under difficult conditions. In essence, they do not get the whole story, until it is over. You may even gen a criminal pretending to be a victim, only to shoot the cops in the back. That is why victims at the crime scene are the best judge of who needs to be shoot first.   For my own personal situation, I do not recommend just buying a gun for protection. Also seek training and lots of it. Then practice, practice, practice, and then practice some more. No matter how justified you are defending your life with firearm, you must still defend your actions in a court of law, especially if human life was taken.   I do not agree with people carrying firearms with no training. That is a very personal decision and I will not stop anyone from carrying a firearm if they choose to do so.	0

And yet quantum physics tends to be very contradictory, at least to our perceptions. Acausal events happen. A particle can be in two places at the same time.

The Word of God says otherwise.   Romans 1:25-27 - They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creatorâ€”who is forever praised...   Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.   You've rewritten Biblical Christianity. 2 Timothy 4:3-4 (New International Version) - For the time will come when they will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.	0

A more precise term would be "broaden," since nothing about the definition pertaining to the people currently covered by it would be affected, "diluted" or altered in any way anyone has yet demonstrated. Nothing about the definition that pertains to people who already are, or can be married changes one iota. Their rights, benefits, and protections remain exactly the same. The only "change" would be to other people, people who have no connection to, nor impact on, the marriages of anyone else: the gays who'll marry if the legal definition is broadened to encompass them. And the only "change" in that regard will be the fact that they are encompassed by it, nothing more. No substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stands changes in the slightest.   The change is not in the definition itself. It's in who it applies to.	0

1. From what I have learned, different locations breed different surroundings. Human ancestors were migratory pack animals. Where they went, they encountered new types of pressures, causing them to change over time.   2. Different selective pressures. Different areas can lead to different pressures. Some mutations also occured etc. Things like that.   Evolution doesn't HAVE to occure non-stop if there is equilibrium. Not everyting is always changing, as far as I learned. Barring mutations that cause significant changes over a lot of time, Apes, Chimps, Monkies wouldn't really change all that much. There's no real pressure to do so. They are already well-adapted to their surroundings.   Actually however, there really isn't that much difference between some of the great apes and Humans. Take the Bonobo Chimps, for example. They have 98% the same DNA as Humans. They are the closest to HOmo Sapien.   3. Niches. Related to above. Crocs, for example, don't evolve that much because they are a very successful animal design and they found a place in which they can thrive for generations with little to no changes. Other animals can do the same.   4. As well, humans didn't come directly from Apes. We all evolved from a common ancestor who did all of the above.   http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/species.html   Here is a time line of hominid species   http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html   http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.html   Evolution doesn't lead to a higher species, as well. There is no hierarchy in nature. Each species is equally as well "evolved" depending on it's environment etc.   A Human is no more evolved than a Chimp or better than a Chimp. Evolution doesn't lead to progression, but merely change. It's not getting better toward some high standard. Humans just like to think so.	0
So you think that, if murders were legal, there would still be the same number?   How about robberies, or rapes? There are plenty of those, the law can't be having any effect...   In short, I'm saying that making anything illegal reduces that thing. Criminalising murder results in less murder, criminalising drugs leads to reduced supply of drugs (compare any drug with nicotine, or alcohol), and criminalising guns would lead to a similar reduction.	1
But people start threads here all the time against Christianity regardless of whether someone claims something here about it or not. It's prejudice, pure and simple, and you're no exception. Now, one would think, being the supposedly non-Christian enlightened person you are, you would simply say "oh, I didn't realize that my posts came across as anti-Christian sometimes, and that it indicates a prejudice on my part, and will try to not have prejudices in my thinking." I mean, one would think those of you are do this sort of thing would be happy that someone had pointed out the obvious prejudice going on, as it would be a case to help you move away from prejudicial thinking.	0

I don't give a damn about the circumstances of the unborn either(obvious here I am not saying I don't care what happens to either, but for the sake of whether or not we should kill the unborn this is my stance). Neither one should have a right to kill the other...and for that matter, no one else should be allowed to come up and murder the women or the unborn. So my views are still treating them as equals.   and I will ask you to stay away from more assumtions that you can't prove.	1

Genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene. Once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection. Why do you think otherwise? Remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations.	0

Currently, your assertion that organisms are "devolving" because of mutations has been shown to be faulty.	0
logic would lead one to believe abortion is wrong...but why be consistent in your thinking.   The point is, logic and rational thinking is not a requirement to make a law. You can ban abortion is you want...the states did it and the constitution allows it, even if 5 legislatures think otherwise.	0
Stop telling me to look at the big picture when you've had both of your eyes gouged out!   Your entire statement here is beyond stupid. If the criminals felt that the only time to be armed was when their intended victims could fight back, then the criminals in DC would never be armed and the police wouldn't have needed to introduce gun shot sensors in the city. But since DC was the murder capital of the United States, that says an absence of hard targets isn't a guarantee that the abusers will play fair and not use weapons.	1
Well all you have to do is tell us the minimum time during which it could happen by NDS theory and then how long it actually took and we can compare the numbers. Of course you will have to detail how you arrived at both sets of numbers. Enjoy	1
So, we on this board aren't receptive to your proselytizing? Sorry about that. This particular forum is intended to be a scientific discussion, based on logic and evidence. We certainly don't want to waste your time. The door is over there. I find your dismissive, superior attitude to be offensive, to be honest., so I can't say I'll miss you.   But should you ever want to discuss evolution and creation in terms of actual science you will be welcome to return.	1
These "infants" do. My mother could have aborted me and she chose to have me.   And if the state decides to keep abortion legal? Then you don't care if these "gifts from God" have a chance or not?	0
Just like no one is really "for" abortions, but they think that it's the woman's right to decide. Maybe that's like when congress gave the President the right to decide to go to war, even when they were supposed to declare war.	0

Oh I hated being pregnant. However I am not really arguing whether pregnancy in and of itself is punishment, I suspect that is an opinion matter - there are some crazy women who actually liked pregnancy.

No, I think you're trying to do more than that. You're trying to say that the increase in crime is due to a lack of gun ownership, aren't you? Because if you are, the article you cite doesn't back up that claim.   What, no actual data to back up any of your claims? Do you have access to US crime numbers? How many armed breakins do you get in a country where people do have guns? That's the comparison that needs to be made here.	0
Great idea. Explain why all the tests that prove it wrong are irrelevant.	1
So when you're doing math, you're an atheist? Of course not. Just because there is overlap doesn't mean that the two views are identical.	0
Actually, if you bothered to pay any attention whatsoever, it actually goes against your point entirely. Just because WSM and I were both in "heterosexual" Style relationships, doesn't change the fact that both of us are indeed homosexuals and therefore proves that homosexuals do indeed have children, planned or not.   Mine too was kind of a suprise. I was on the "pill" but was also taking antibiotics at the time and for anyone who doesn't already know, antibiotics will completely cancel out the affects of the birth control pill. I was NOT aware of this at the time and low-and-behold I ended up pregnant with my son.   p.s. just for general information, I was not taking "the pill" for birth control reasons.   Not all women who are prescribed it are even sexually active at all. The birth control pill contains synthetic or naturally dirived female hormones, which for some women aids them in attaining a more regular period. Many women atheletes are prescribed birth control because being extremely athletic can disrupt, postpone or completely do away with a woman's natural cycle. Taking birth control helps to "normalize" female hormone levels. Such was my case.	0
All forms of life? Animal life? Plant life? The mold growing in your bathroom?	1
The simple fact is that people don't want the immense responsibility that logically pertains to their voluntary actions actions, so they fabricate denials of reality as a convenient escape, out of pure selfishness-- like every other atrocity in history.   The study of law includes an analysis of how people excuse their wrongdoings, fabricating pausible rationalizations for their acting to benefit at another's expense; denial is typically the first of these, claiming that the act "does not hurt anyone," however obvious the contrary. Other rationales follow, such as self-preservation, natural right to act, and eventually growing defensive by blaming the victim.   While the fabricator typically believes his story original, it is anything but-- it's simply the inevitable course of selfishness.	0
So SS. Please explain it all to me. Please show that you are not conclusion jumping and making unwarranted extrapolation based on poor understanding of the material. In other words, show me that you understand by explaining the research to me.   Thanks.	1
Well, I suppose creationists would object to careful definition of terms and the assiduous distinguishing of fact from non-fact, wouldn't they? It runs counter to all they hold dear.	1
If this is true, then it should cover the fetus since there is no difference between the fetus and the infant besides size and location. Every adult was once a teen, every teen was once a child, every child was once an infant and every infant was once a fetus.	0
Then show the evidence.	0
Hmm . . . funny, I don't remember ever hearing a pro-lifer say that pregnancy was a wonderful snuggly thing or the best thing in the world. What I do see is pro-lifers like myself wondering why pregnancy is protrayed (in the form of a generalization) as so horrible by people such as yourself who just described it as "unbelievably" hard to go through, or a "life threatening condition" like malignant cancer. You didn't qualify it by saying "some" pregnancies are life threatening or unbearable. Maybe yours was, but how can you say that for every woman in the world? I know for a fact that my wife's pregnancy was not "unbelievably hard to go through"--she's told me otherwise and I believe her. Sorry, but I believe my wife over you.   What you did was use unfounded generalizations, which is exactly the sort of thing this thread is about.	0

You are like, so totally noble and sensitive! I really admire your pro-humanity stance. That is going out on limb.	1
You ask others for their opinion, and then refuse to listen when it's offered.   The truth is that you don't see the analogy as valid.   We do.   We see a situation where, like blacks before, people disapprove of a group of people and want to segregate one group from the other.   Sometimes, they refuse to offer any alternative.   Sometimes, they offer a separate alternative.   That argument cuts both ways.   The question comes up regarding what's YOUR beef on the issue?   Why are you so insistent on maintaining two separate groups?   Is it because you want to reserve marriage as "prestigous" whereby gays are kept out?   Under interracial marriage, no black person was prohibited from marrying either.   Should people have been satisfied with interracial couples being classified as "civil unions"?   Today, we recognize that racism is wrong.   Yet some people still persist with homophobia. They fail to have a historical context on the real meaning of the methodology they recommend.   Frankly, that's like saying "You can't be Jewish, but you can pick any sect of Christianity you want to. You can't wear a star of david, but you can wear a cross.   So that's *equal*"...   You're saying we can marry HETEROSEXUALLY, so HOMOSEXUALS must pretend that's equal???   Makes no sense...   If I call somebody "male", that restricts no rights from them.   It doesn't require they go to a separate place to get their rights.   And quite frankly, insisting on keeping one definition FOR A RIGHT (at the exclusion of gays) is "satisfying the ego" of the homophobic group.   "attack on the definition of marriage"?   Why is it an "attack" to include gay couples in as married?   Would it be an "attack" on something for blacks to not have to be segregated from whites?	1
So, you're just an anti-geologist, anti-cosmologist, anti-archaeologist, anti-physicist, and probably a few more that I can't be arsed to think of right now. *shrugs* Might as well get it over with and just say you're an anti-science religious nutter.	1

If we were created in God's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of God's emotions. That our emotions are imperfect versions of his.   Of course I would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. And to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. An 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right.	0

F--k'in A! right! I don't want some damn MAN deciding what's going to be legal for my body. They have NO experience with the female anatomy except what they manage to bag, they shouldn't be allowed to decide for us.   They have no idea what pregnancy is like, the damage it does to our bodies and our minds, and they don't have to pay to support a child that we were forced to accept at knifepoint.   Where is the logic is violating women a second time? Where's the justification for it? Doesn't the life of the unintended mother account for anything at all?   Do you men have any idea of the dangerous precdent you'd be setting up with a total ban on abortion? Women who have been raped and essentially told "You WILL have this child, you WILL carry it to term, or you WILL go to prison!" would likely commit suicide as a result, meaning that TWO lives are gonna be lost.	1
oh, sure...ok...whatever you say.	1
Oh really? Gun ownership allowed these "lunatics" as you call them, to become government dictators? If I owned 50 guns and 10,000 rounds of ammunition, you're saying I could run the government with an iron fist all by myself, just like that? Any random person can just appoint themselves God over the entire nation, without a single ounce of resistance just because they're armed?	1
Don't get me wrong sleazyrider I love babies, they're delicious!	1

You mean Priests? Because I hear the ladies are crawling all over them, can't get enough of that catholic loving...	1

Well as long as you ignore the evidence, why do you need proof. Blind faith works just fine.	1
Actually, it's not conjecture. The genetic makeup of the several subspecies of arctic foxes bear it out. The dominant allele is rare because it is less adaptive. The dominant allele is most likely ancestral. But even foxes below the Arctic circle show differences in their fur between summer and winter. So yes, foxes that were able to change color in the north had a differential reproductive advantage over those who couldn't.	0
A perfect example of why Christian fundamentalismm and evolution can't co-exist. If God is wrong, then the Bible is wrong. Evolution contradicts the Bible, plain and simple.	0
Whether a fetus is a person is not something open to consideration. An apple is not an orange. The reason that we have two words to apply as labels is simply because they absolutely are not the same thing. It is that simple.

You believe that your interpretation of the Christian Bible is more correct than his, and he believes that his interpretation of the Christian Bible is more correct than yours. This is quite simple, but that's never really helped you see the problem before...   Yeesh. Even when I spell it out, he still can't keep it straight.   No, marc, you're looking at the wrong quote. Try reading what I write.   Yes, you can expect accusations of quote mining to be common when you commonly quote mine. Say, do you think these two things could possibly be related?   "Concise and readable" takes a backseat to accurate. As I said, Miller overemphasizes views outside the mainstream of atheism and tries to paint all of atheism with the same brush. In fact, he picks a single atheist to spend three paragraphs on, then moves past his exaggerated claim. And with good reason.   marc's impeccable reading comprehension strikes again. marc thinks I was responding to a different point, despite the clear explanation of his "citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts."   I figure it's his latest attempt at a dodge. Ignorance and incomprehensible babbling has gotten old to him, apparently.   Considering atheists don't believe in the supernatural, there's nothing else left. Now tell me how your truism actually means anything.   Lewontin did not say to forbid access to the Bible or other texts. You simply assume that he said that because you want to build as much of a strawman as you possibly can. See, if you had just quoted Lewontin instead of trying to censor his words, maybe you would have understood. ... Then again, probably not. I keep forgetting that your Persecution switch is fused in the "on" position.   Yes, Lewontin mentions the New York Times... the home furnishing supplement of the New York Times, in metaphoric comparison to the stage set of The Honeymooners. But you don't have a problem with your blatant misrepresentation, do you? No, no, anything to brainwash the kiddies and advance your delusion of massive conspiracy...   If Miller truly does understand Lewontin's point, he does a pisspoor job of explaining it. Lewontin says to eliminate the irrational and employ the intellectual. Frankly, I see nothing wrong with this; why do you?   The best case you'll ever be able to make regarding Lewontin's claims in this book is that he believes that a certain path to truth is the most effective. You claim that your path to truth is the most effective. Once again, we have no reason to believe either one of you over the other based on these statements alone.   Which Dawkins books that promote atheism (and by atheism, I mean atheism, not evolution) are required reading in public schools? Cite specific instances and include evidence that the ACLU rejected the cases.   This coming from the person who omitted so much that I had to elaborate on and quote from the book multiple times? No thanks, I'd rather make fun of your whining and your incomprehensible comprehension.   Oh, you didn't read the part where he distanced himself from atheism? The one where he explained that evolution is compatible with theism? I guess you missed it... It was only, you know, the vast majority of the book.   Oh, good, I get to do this again! They're not Christians, just like Judge Jones isn't a Lutheran. (Your foot should still be in your mouth over that one, but you never learn.) They're all phonies, aren't they, marc? Lucky for marc, he can accurately assess people's belief systems without knowing the slightest thing about their beliefs. But I have this "power," too:marc is an atheist. Sure, he says all this fundie Christian stuff, but he's really an atheist. I know it in my heart because my own belief system, infallible and based upon the teachings of God himself, tells me so. I know, because I know Christians, and marc's not a Christian. He's just a big phony.   And there you go... atheist. Clearly, I've correctly labeled you, and you are nothing but a false teacher.Pathetic, marc. Absolutely, positively pathetic.   In other words, marc has absolutely no resolution to this conundrum except to leave us with this oh-so-powerful exchange:   marc [about Miller]: "He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do."   Miller [about marc]: "He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do."   *ahem*....   marc [about Miller]: "He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do."   Miller [about marc]: "He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do."   Yes, I'd speculate that he doesn't have such trouble "stomaching" priests. After all, he shares their beliefs, and not those of preachers of other (e.g. Protestant) sects, many of whom refuse to recognize Catholicism as truly Christian...   Keep on diggin', marc. I love helping you reach new lows.	1

The quality of life ethic is far different from sactity/dignity of life ethic. A quality of life ethic carried out to its logical conclusions does not promote a pro-life society.

The problem with this ethic is that it is centered in arbritrary people deciding arbritarily which person passes the "quality of life" test.	0

Biblical literism is the only way to view the Bible. I could 'metaphorically' say that Dawkins really believes in God in his own way, because he said that ID is possible for this planet because aliens may have seeded the first self replicating molecule here Millions of years ago.   That is silliness or even foolishness. Nothing taken literally from the Bible is irrational. God is rational and His creation is rational.   In fact, the "Scientific Method" originated from the idea that the Physical Universe operates on rational physical laws because the Creator did it in logical fashion.   What did we have b4 that?

Well regulated as in the second amendment does not mean regulated by the government, it means well equiped and prepared.

I'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species. The Canid species, specifically the Gray Wolf, or the Canis lupus which the domesticated dog is an extremely close relative of, differing from it by at most 0.2% of mtDNA sequence.   The evolution of the domestic dog   The earliest remains of the domestic dog date from 10 to15 thousand years ago21; the diversity of these remains suggests multiple domestication events at different times and places. Dogs may be derived from several different ancestral gray wolf populations, and many dog breeds and wild wolf populations must be analysed in order to tease apart the genetic sources of the domestic dog gene pool. A limited mtDNA restriction fragment analysis of seven dog breeds and 26 gray wolf populations from different locations around the world has shown that the genotypes of dogs and wolves are either identical or differ by the loss or gain of only one or two restriction sites22. The domestic dog is an extremely close relative of the gray wolf, differing from it by at most 0.2% of mtDNA sequence.   In comparrison, the gray wolf differs from its closest wild relative, the coyote, by about 4% of mitochondrial DNA sequence14 (Fig. 4). Therefore, the molecular genetic evidence does not support theories that domestic dogs arose from jackal ancestors24. Dogs are gray wolves, despite their diversity in size and proportion; the wide variation in their adult morphology probably results from simple changes in developmental rate and timing 25.

Don't you think this would fit the 'Creationism is nothing but lie's thread a bit better? Although I notice The Skeptic making disparaging remarks about your examples, it seems he attacks you more than deal with the well documented   examples you have.	0
Actually, that honour is reserved for the usual representations of those who advocate young earth creationism.	1
Well, all I can say then is that no action is just about as bad as failed action, and IS as bad in terms of anything current. Either way you don't have gay marriage. You have a majority in Congress right now, and you're not demanding much change just because of fear of backlash? Yeah, there would be backlash. Heck, the Civil War was the ultimate backlash, but that didn't stop abolitionists from demanding more than TOKEN change, and it's a good thing they did. It's your gig, though, so do what you want. I don't see much point in laboring this discussion any more; I'm just pointing out my observations.	0
No, they do not. I know several people in England who posess weapons the bought on the street. How are the gun laws in england working when you can buy a machine gun?   Before the ban, england had lower numbers when it came to firearms related deaths. They also had lower crime numbers. The sociological differences between England and the United States are not be be discounted.   It is interesting to note that crime rates in England seem to be rising now that the gun ban has been around for a while. There is even a movement by public officials to arm police officers in response to the rising rate of violent crime. There isa n article and debate about it right here on the forums.   The biggest difference lately in the statistics in England in the US is not the numbers, it is how they are recorded. If a guy is confronted by three people outside a bar and shot to death, but the gus get off during trial, it is still recorded in America s a three person homocide. In england, it is NOT recorded. I get the London Times, and they have done several articles accusing th British government of manipulating crime figures. I think that if we in America only recorded solved crimes in our crime statistics, we might become one of the most cime free contries in the world!	0
Well, given that your term is a fabrication of the creationist's mind, I suppose you're right. Evolutionists don't actually exist. Therefore you could assign whatever traits you wanted to them, including dishonesty. Evolutionist is a term designed to cast evolution as a faith based notion. The problem is there is no faith in evolution, faith is a belief in something with no proof. Evolution has proof. Therefore it cannot be a faith based idea. A typical creationist attack is to misrepresent their target by creating a strawman of it. They then declare it is wrong and by proxy, the actual theory wrong. It's fundementally weak, but inline with a belief that is scientifically unsound.	0
The quad 50 full automatic anti-aircraft gun is designed to oscillate on it's mount. This is so that the bullets will come out in a pattern. This pattern along with tracer rounds helps the shooter guide the blizzard of bullets at the aircraft. Even this only works at low altitudes. Modern planes typically fly at ~30K feet. That's more than 5 miles high! A perfect bullet, or one that is fired in a vaccum with an initial velocity of 2800 fps will only go ~25k feet before gravity alone will have reduced it's velocity to 0 fps. The odds of hitting something that is moving at ~900 fps at any distance with a bullet traveling at ~2800fps are slim to none. That is why anti-aircraft guns are full auto, not a semiauto or anything that a citizen has access to legally.	0
So the intent hiding behind abortion laws all along was to keep women in the gutter. There was not any legititamte concern for the unborn fetus. It was all about how they could keep women down. Tell me then, would someone who supports a ban on partial birth abortion do so simply because they want to repress women?	0
Why should I prove anything, you never do.	0
But your proof didn't claim that God could do anything possible. Maybe only one person could build a computer, maybe one person could make a car, maybe one person could run the mile in under 4 minutes. That doesn't mean that God can do ALL of these things. It means that whoever we define to be the greatest being, we can call him god and thus he exists. Of course this wouldn't be sufficient to Christians as this says that God is probably mortal and has the limits of being a physical being.	0
But then it also doesn't answer the question "does anything exist", nor does it answer an infinite number of "existence" questions. Do "trolls" exist, follows the same reasoning. If you find one, they are no longer a fairy tale/imaginary creature, they are some organic life form that can be measured, tested, and quantified..i.e. no longer an imaginary creature. So they can no more be found than god.   So replace god/troll with an infinite number of other imaginary things and you'll see why the question "Does god exist?", has no real importance in the physical universe.   (does the tooth fairy exist, does a unicorn exist, do flying pigs exist, etc.)   In fact, I like that statement. The existence of god is not imporant...   Rather - the FAITH in god(s, etc.) is what is "important", and the thoughts most certainly exist in the physical world and have a measureable impact.   I think that's why I don't mind so much "religion" per se, it's the human condition that brings suffering, and uncertainty, into our lives and for some people, the feelings brought about by their faith seems to treat the condition. (the human condition also brings joy, love, etc., but I'd like that without the pain personally)   I only mind it when things in the physical universe are "attacked" with the premise of belief in god(s), which is a waste of human energy...we have a limited time, don't spend it using fallacy to undermine those who are actually trying to build on the foundation of human knowledge. And any belief in something without evidence scares me if it becomes a driving force behind decisions.   ...she's a witch because she MADE the crops die...she must be burned.   ...he broke "god's" law and therefore must be guilty..   ...this is "god's" war..   Yeah, that still scares me. That's why I think, at least in the US, the seperation of church and state is so ridiculously important, and accepted. While there are fundamentalists that rail against it...it's hopefully obvious that with ~80% of the US believing in an imaginary "god", but also having a separation of church and state and the most generally advanced scienctific community in the world, then the two can obviously co-exist, and I'd go so far as to say thrive as long as the line is drawn and not crossed.   I learned something in responding, thanks for the spark.   -Mach	0

So you plan to move out of N.Y.in a year or two,and own a gun?why not now?N.Y.laws are sticker than most,but not all.You want to teach your kids to shoot?Better do it now,later on it will probably be harder.   Well if you don't think that gun control is the most important issue in the world and you totally agree that people should be able to own guns,but yet you have no problems with states making it mandatory for gun owners to have permits,thats almost a contradiction of terms for someone that says their pro gun.   I may be wrong but is anyone saying or implying total gun freedom?   What we are saying is, to many laws on it no more.   35-40 years ago we didn't have all this B.S.about it,you wanted a gun you went and got one (in other words very readily available)   Walk down the street with one and you didn't have a S.W.A.T.team on you.   We have seen to many gun rights taken so yeah every time a new policy or   amendment comes along we are antsy about it.   So if you support every amendment made to the constitution pertaining to guns, than I submit your not to interested in owning a gun.   And for the record:gun toting bandits(out here we say bandito's)are jumping   out of every ally{figuratively speaking}.But the pro-gunners know that if the   anti-gunners had their way,only the bandito's have guns.	1
as in anyone can purchase a fire arm without a background check or gun safety training? not a good option. my apology if that was a failed sarcasm.   -a|ex	1

Well since posting on this thread has died and this seems to me to be the most interesting atheistic theory, I want to get a bit of clarification.   First, what do you mean by being allowed to cease providing for it at any age, but never allowed to kill it? By this do you mean that to cease providing for during the first trimester is not killing it? Is that because it is not alive at that time?   If I follow you (and I'm not sure I do) should the mother be allowed to have the baby removed at some point during the third trimester, after which it must be kept alive (and perhaps put up for adoption)?	0
And thus the human condition is explained at last!	1
How curious that not everyone can admit that this kind of treatment is wrong. How interesting that another issue comes up instead of addressing the blatant, in-your-face kind of mistreatment of an individual making a private, personal decision.

and a quote from jitobear:	0
It depends on the particular situation. Some adoption agencies ask about it, and some don't. Most social workers who do home studies are aware that they have gay clients doing adoptions. Some adoptive gay parents are out about it, and some keep it quiet.   There are currently some foreign countries that require adoptive single parents to sign an affadavit that says, "I am not homosexual." Those are the rules of some foreign countries, notably China, not the United States or any state.   China has recently placed greater restrictions on prospective adoptive parents. They have sharply limited the opportunities for single people to adopt, and it looks like they may prohibit single-parent adoptions entirely. They have also instituted a weight requirement for all adoptive parents. In the case of a couple, their combined weight has to be below a certain figure or they are not allowed to adopt. No fat people allowed to adopt, which cuts out possibly most Americans.	0
Can your intellect explain infinity...such a tasty word	1
Because there are people who are trying to deny the theory of evolution it's place as a vital part of public school's biology curriculum.	0
And it isn't the job of the school to teach anyone about your god. That is the job of the parents. If it is a good idea to teach about your god in the public school, it is also a good idea to teach about mine. How about Wicca and Islam. A good idea, right?   But if some creationists don't like their children learning science, then they should put them in their own "christian" schools where they can become scientific illiterates who think that heliocentrism is a fact.	1

FDR saved this country? If I recall, it was in 1933 that, because of a combination of weakened capital situations from Reconstruction Finance Corporation loans which published lists of the loan takers, and a nation-wide banking holiday, banks around the country went through a new wave of demise, dropping the D/C and D/R ratios so sharply that, in one month alone, the money stock (M2) fell a whopping 4 1/2%.   Wasnt it under FDR that the NIRA codes, and, after 1935, the NLRA, enacted minimum wages, driving up nominal wages and thus unemployment?   Wasnt it during FDR administration that the reserve ratio was *doubled*, sending us back into another recession starting 1937?   The only thing FDR "saved" was the depression for a couple more years.   -GFA	1
Tell me who directed it.	0
Well, that just means I'm a more capable lump of cells now than I was when I was first conceived. I started doing what most embryos do when they are first formed, and that is develop. I'm still developing. I can't seem to stop it. I think my body has stopped growing (in height anyway), but seem to keep filling my brain with more and more experience.   The point I was trying to make is that since there is a continuum of existence between conception and death, there is no line you can draw (save birth, which may or may not be considered an arbitrary boundary to personhood) that would constitute some sort of a change in what you are.   I started as one cell and continued to grow and develop, which I am still doing now. If I am a person now, I was a person when I was the zygote.   If we are going to talk about aortion in this society we should be honest about it and not try to mince words when it come to killing a baby. I'm not "anti-choice" but I think we should honestly recognize that an embryo is a living human individual that dies when it is aborted. That thought turns most people off so they have to make themselves believe that an abortion is not a killing since the embryo wasn't a person. Logically, it is a killing. A life was ended. The question then becomes, is it murder? I don't happen to think that, but it is really quite subjective anyway.	0
What in the Hell does evolution have to do with people doing bad things? I am a believer in creation by God and have never heard such drivel. BOY-HOWDY!!!	0
Jurassic Theropods like Compsognathus had hollow bones.   http://www.cbv.ns.ca/marigold/histor...gnathuspic.jpg   Therepodian dinosaurs show clear general skeletal affinities with modern birds such as long limbs, hollow bones, foot with 3 toes in front and 1 reversed toe behind and a long ilium.   Coelophysis, from the late Triassic was one of the first theropod dinosaurs.   Deinonychus and Oviraptor from the late Triassic to the Cretaceous were bipedal advanced theropods, larger, with more bird-like skeletal features: semilunate carpal, bony sternum, long arms and reversed pubis. Striking detailed similarity to birds.   There is a gap in the fossil record here although Protoavis could belong here, unfourtunately, the fossil is poor.   Archaeopteryx from 225 Ma, shows a mosaic of reptilian and avian features, with the reptilian features predominating. The skull and skeleton are basically reptilian (skull, teeth, vertebrae, sternum, ribs, pelvis, tail, digits, claws, generally unfused bones). Bird traits are limited to an avian furcula (wishbone, for attachment of flight muscles; recall that at least some dinosaurs had this too), modified forelimbs, and -- the real kicker -- unmistakable lift-producing flight feathers. Archeopteryx could probably flap from tree to tree, but couldn't take off from the ground, since it lacked a keeled breastbone for large flight muscles, and had a weak shoulder compared to modern birds. (Wellnhofer, 1993)   S. santensis from 138 Ma was a better flyer than Archaeopteryx. It had a short trunk, claws on the toes, flight-specialized shoulders, stronger flight- feather bones, tightly folding wrist and short hands.   A not yet named bird/dino from 131 Ma has a reptilian pelvis and legs, with bird-like shoulders. The tail is medium-length with a fused tip.   Then there's Hesperornis, Ichthyornis, and other Cretaceous diving birds. There are many fossils. Their skeleton is further modified for flight showing fusion of pelvis bones, fusion of hand bones and a short, fused tail). It also still had true socketed teeth, a reptilian trait.   There are others and this is by no mean exhaustive. This is just to show that there are very good transition lineages.   Although no modern birds have teeth, chicken bills can be induced to develop teeth, indicating that chickens still retain the genes for making teeth.   There is also an intriguing fossil Microraptor gui that has flight feathers on both the front and back legs.   http://eur.news1.yimg.com/eur.yimg.c...2567138235.jpg   I can provide more info on any of these if you wish.

You know, I cannot even remember if we covered it in middle school or high school biology. I do remember learning about Mendel and his genetics, but I swear I can't remember if we even mentioned Darwin's name. If we spent any time on it at all, it was very little.   Our biology classes were mostly devoted to taxonomy, anatomy/physiology, and cellular machinery.	0
believing that god doesnt exist or acknowledging the fact that evidence to support the existence of god has never been found does not equate to science being anti-religious or that science hates religion. in fact, the one thing that both science and religion have in common is acknowledging that belief in god is not based on observable evidence, but rather an individual choice to apply faith in something which cannot be seen or proven. on the one hand, religion continually reaches that in order to believe in god, you must have faith that god is real despite a marked lack of evidence for god's existence. science concludes the same thing: that people who believe in the existence of god do so solely by faith, despite the lack of observable evidence to back this belief   the bottom line is that science does not make religion obsolete by reiterating the fact that there is no evidence for god. religious people also already knows this, and believe in god regardless	0
I think you sound rather immature. And actually, it's tough luck for you, Chuzlife. Because the law is not on your side. And I doubt women who are exercising their Constitutional rights are going to tell you about what's going on with their bodies or within their privacy of their relationships with their physicians and/or family members.   Nor do I blame them one bit.   And just to clarify your position for the board, on this "child" definition you keep insisting on. Do you mean to use that terminology for a fertilized egg, too?   As in the photograph I shared earlier?   :flutteringeyelashes:	0
(Note the key word "also," which admits that it's human).   As for the rest, This is more of the sort of "defensive rationalization" I talked about earlier, i.e. when people find it more rewarding to self-righteously defend their wrongdoings and thus shirk their responsibility to others, than to shoulder the burdens to those they have harmed, and thus they act in self-absorbed narcissism and sociopathic dissociation, while likewise waxing arrogant in self-deceiving affirmation of their own "brilliance" and other superiority to do as they please, by simply denying said consequences however obvious-- illustrated here, by simply calling a fetus a "parasite" and thus daintily strutting off away from one's obvious duties to it, despite admitting it's also human.   However, a human being forced into dependency on another for its life, is not a "parasite," but a VICTIM, and thus has the right to aid from the ones responsible for that dependency.   Since you've admitted that it's human, then the remainder is plain; it also has the right to aid from the one responsible for its dependency, i.e. the man and woman in question who proximately caused it to be in its dependent situation through their willful actions in full knowledge of that risk.   Here, the doctrine of Strict Liability would apply, in that normal sexual contact carries the inherent risk of pregnancy.   This doctrine already applies to men, and should likewise apply to women who choose to abort in spite of their responsibility to the prenatal human in question, created and made dependent on her for its life through her intentional actions.	0

I'd love to see an explanation about how the study of the natural world disproves the existence of all Deities. Especially the Deistic Gods. And I'd love to see how science is suppose to disprove a being that is not bound by logic, reason or any laws. What science can do is disprove that God was directly responsible for this or that, the sun rising, the rain season, etc. Did you perhaps realize that many scientists are Buddhists because Buddhism which has beings that behave as Gods with such powers and exist partially within the natural and supernatural? Or are you again assuming all religions don't exist except for Christanity?	1

And your logic about taking criminals off the street and then having no gun control concerns would be perfect...if we had a finite number of criminals. We don't. New murderers and theives and carjackers and dope dealers and bank robbers and child rapists are born every day.	1
Why do people on the pro-gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue? No one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns. The question is would there be less murders without guns. In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders. At any rate, I don't think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident.	0
And you are proud of that?	1
Nothing like quoting experts willing to stick their scientific necks out, huh?   Or in your second quote:   "But it now appears the warming from greenhouse gases has been offset by a strong cooling effect from dimming - in effect two of our pollutants have been cancelling each other out.   This means that the climate may in fact be more sensitive to the greenhouse effect than previously thought."   Huh?	1

Well, if you don't want a reaction, I would prefer if you not use the word "god" since it is loaded with so many other meanings and conotations than those you say you mean.   The choice between our two stances is indeed one between choosing a moral stance based on reasoned analysis (imperfect as that may be) and choosing a moral stance based on blind faith (i.e. not supported by evidence) in a moral code dictated by a religious authority.   You say that my moral code is a code that puts faith only in myself. That is not true. I very openly acknowledge that if I never had input from the outside - moral codes which were presented to me with the reasons behind them - then my moral code as determined solely by myself would have been meager indeed. I have had a wide range of influences which have helped determined my moral code:   - The moral codes of my folks during my upbringing   - The moral code of the moderate form of Roman Catholicism I grew up with   - The moral codes generally accepted by the moderate Democratic part of society   - The moral stances of friends   - The moral philosophy of Kant and other philosophers I have read about   I am sure that I could even come up with more than that. From all of those, I have gleaned a morality that works best for me, where my moral code seems to be quite a common one. The moral rules which I accepted were typically the ones which gave the reasons behind them and whose base assumptions I agreed with. The moral rules which I rejected were typically the ones which gave no supporting reasons or whose base assumptions I disagreed with. I suspect that you assume that if a morality is not grounded in religious rules, then it becomes based on selfishness. That is not true. We are all inspired by heroes that sacrifice themselves for others - be they secular or religious (as Jesus himself can be viewed as a hero).   There is a lot of overlap in morality between secular morality and religious (mainly Christian) morality - against theft, murder, etc. However, I find too many of the religious rules very arbitrary (such as the anti-Gay propaganda, some religion's ban on contraceptives, the idea of the infalibility of the pope, etc.) that I certainly will not follow religious rules blindly. Furthermore, so much of religious morality was determined simply by religious men who were set in the local morality of their time and attached that morality to the religion. Even if Jesus was divine, it would be very hard today to know how to throw away all the junk morality that was added after his time and extract the pure origin.	0
