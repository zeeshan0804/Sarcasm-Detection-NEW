So, you consider a so called theory which allows a 10 billion year gap out of an alleged potential 10 to 20 billion year age for the occurrence to be the most credible theory? And is actually supported by evidence? If they have any evidence, why the 10 billion year gap for wiggle room? No wonder you accept evolution as a rational possibility. The fact is, they have no credible evidence at all as the big bang is nothing more than a deduction based on theoretical mathematical equations which can neither be confirmed or verified.   Just read the link and consider the factors cosmologists must consider before even doing the math required to come up with an age. Now consider how skewed the outcome must be if they are incorrectly interpreting even one aspect of the info they are relying on for the equations which result in an age.   Any errors in those results and the out equations are useless. Thus, the 10 billion year gap in their cosmological guessing game.   How Old is the Universe?   Now consider the creator of the big bang theory itself. Edwin Hubble proposed the big bang as a possible beginning of the Universe based on the perceived expansion of the universe from a tiny central singularity back in 1929. Since then it has become the holy grail of the scientific community in explaining how Time and Space began. http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/bigbang.htm   This theory is made up of nothing more than the imaginings of a young cosmologist back in 1929 yet has been adopted as a rational theory by the scientific community as if they are a bunch of lemmings who will grasp at any explanation which doesn't claim that God did it.	1

In fact, its first point is that today's cats have no problem reproducing for several generations on today's cooked food. The difference is that good owners don't feed their pets deficient diets.   The real irony here is that this experiment -- were it reliable -- would be the antithesis of supersport's Lamarckism. In order for supersport to be supported, the cats being fed inadequate diets would re-develop those broken pathways for manufacturing essential amino acids. Obviously, they did not. The only thing we see here is the effect of poor (i.e. positively malnutritive) diet.   We can conclude that supersport's Morton's demon is pretty much in full control. There's no other explanation for somebody seeing this experiment and thinking it supports Lamarckism, or even counters evolutionary theory, even if he doesn't know the basics of experimentation and nutrition.	1

Had paired fins with a leg-like arrangement of bones, and had an early-amphibian-like skull and teeth.   Eusthenopteron (and other rhipidistian crossopterygian fish) -- intermediate between early crossopterygian fish and the earliest amphibians. Skull very amphibian-like. Strong amphibian-like backbone. Fins very like early amphibian feet.   Icthyostegids (such as Icthyostega and Icthyostegopsis) -- Terrestrial amphibians with many of Eusthenopteron's fish features (e.g., the fin rays of the tail were retained). Some debate about whether Icthyostega should be considered a fish or an amphibian; it is an excellent transitional fossil.

Is that a trick question? No, the tabloid and other gutter press keep going on about how bad it is, because they sell papers by fanning fear and hatred, and fear of crime is one of their biggest markets. Yes there has been an increase in gun crime over the years, but that's largely attributable to increased attractiveness of crime in a society where social mobility has come to a standstill. In any case the number of incidents where firearms are used in crime is still very small, which is why every time someone gets shot it is headline news.   Guns are incredibly rare in this country, the only time I've seen guns in real life (other than air rifles) is on a military base.	0

Well, man might someday gain the capability of fully synthasizing a molecule as complex as DNA from scratch. Of course, he would use the knowledge gained from studying how various DNA codes affect natural biological characteristics in order to properly design that DNA to achieve the desired characteristics. It might be even more difficult to then take that synthesized DNA and put it in an egg and artificial womb that has no natural (as opposed to artificial) biological parts, but even that might be achievable someday through chemical construction. All this means is that humanity might someday be able to copy the methods of nature to create a new being - perhaps even use creativity to create beings of very different natural functions than we see in our world.   It is all interesting to think about and could well be achievable within this century. We already are capable of a large degree of genetic manipulation through cloning and hybridization. One would think that it will only be a matter of time before more complex technologies get developed.   The other question, of course, is - If we could someday create new life using our technology, should we? That would bring up a whole host of issues, including:   - Would we know what we were doing well enough not to cause great harm?   - How would the beings we create be treated?	0

as far as all observable evidence dictates, the laws of nature are what sustains the universe. there is not one single function of nature that isnt on "autopilot" as it were. that is, no function needed to sustain the universe occurs outside of natural law. what's more, nothing that defies natural law (whether universe-sustaining or not) ever occurs in observable reality   I'm glad you responded Nu Leader. this is this issue that really hits the religion/science divide. as it is, God has been gradually and subliminally coralled in the spiritual realm. there is absolutely nothing in the physical and observable world that is a function of God, or a manifestation of supernatural power. in other words, in the realm of the physical, God has no turf. even if God does exist, he does not (and by biblical definition, cannot) physically manifest his being nor the effect of his power   this leaves us with the spiritual realm. this realm, whether it exists or not, does affect people. yet this realm is as elusive and intangible as God himself. the same realm that God is believed to abive and reign in, is said to be the same realm that humans enter only when they die. i have many thoughts about the effects of this spiritual realm on reality, but for now i think its sufficient to say that God is limited to the spiritual realm only	0

The basic argument is that stuff, from the universe, to people, to eyeballs, to DNA, is too complex to have "just happened".

Well, HRC estimates that the costs would be negligable and that some governments would actually save money.

Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological.

Among the icons (idols) of modern mysticism there is one that reigns supreme. It is the myth of evolution. We scoff at the gods of the anchient pagans as if we were untouched by their superstition and yet we mystify our science with the likes of Darwin, the high priest of natural selection. Darwin taught a fable that started in a warm little pond and through a process that has became known as gradualism (minute changes over eons) all life arose out of a primordial soup.   Life is not chaotic it is orderly and requires replication. Without this you just have a lot of chemicals mixing in an infinite variety. The reason that life must be derived from life (biogenesis) in the minds of most is that this is the only way we have ever seen it happen. "You can imagine anything you like but you can only understand the truth" as Newton said. Now if amino acids are the mirror image of nucleic acid sugars and this in true of all living things then we are limited to this as fundamental to life. This in my opinion is the fundamental first step and it cannot happen peicemeal, it all has to happen all at once.   One more thing, evolution is a biogenesis theory and actual evidence for abiogenesis is rare and fragmentary just as it is for every other aspect of the single common ancestor model.	0

In nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression."

What is denied is that mutations are environmentally directed - in other words, exposure to cosmic radiation will not cause a mutation that will make the organism resistant to cosmic radiation. The mutations will be random.   On the other hand, natural selection IS, by definition, the response of populations to their environment. The environment has been shown to have effects on DNA, i.e., the genome of the population.	0

But the civil war wasn't fought for slavery. If you will recall the average northern soldier wasn't too fond of blacks, and that is not only sugar coating it, but saying it in the nicest terms possible. The civil war was fought to keep the union in tact. Border states still kept their slaves for obvious reasons, the intactness of the union trumped any moral principal. Besides, that wasn't true even in practice. Black soldiers were paid less, had less equipment, had less medical care and were given the worst jobs possible. Hardly created equal. It took some time before they could even fight. Your argument is a load of garbage to someone who actually has knownledge about the civil war.   I won't even go into the reconstruction period and how your so called principal didn't even exist.	0

And these are psalms, which are just popular prayers rather than the word of God arn't they?   Rather than go with the slightly bizarre 'well you're not King David are you...' type response, I could see it being fairly reasonable that God 'knows' people who are born. He might 'know of' the various individuals who are misscarried, die at birth or are aborted but what exactly does he know in relation to them?   Do our souls have their own personalities completely seperate from our mortal ones that are shaped as much by our souls as genes and experience - or does God 'know' them through the billions of other possible universes, i.e he knows them from somewhere/when they didn't die. But if that counts then that means our souls are spread out over an infinite number of copies of us. If so then surely the threat of Hell is irrelevant, either we are doomed because clearly some version of reality has us being evil (I've seen enough TV shows to know that this is pratically 100% certain.) or the soul is something seperate from us and our actions?	0

Yes, because its THEIR decision, its THEIR stomachs, and its THEIR lives. I agree that some decisions do need to be made with parental consent, but not this one.   Irrelevant. How does purchasing a house have to do with abortion?   Ok, so what if the kid wants to have the baby and the adults want to get rid of it? What if the adults want her to have the baby and the kid wants to get rid of it? You would force the kid to have a child (that doesn't seem responsible at all), or you would force the kid to abort her child (thereby taking away her son or daughter). Both of those decisions don't sound very consitent or responsible. The decision is best left up to the person that is pregnant, regardless of their age.	0

That's because its sophistry. Its an inherent contradiction and it simply means we don't have the capacity to understand it.

Damn are we ever conceited as a race...we seem to think that if we can't understand something, it cannot be.

Well, I see that Hunter continues with his intentional ignorance.

Yes, evolution is a theory. In science that means that it has been tested and accepted as essentially correct. Evolution is a theory just as gravity is a theory - several in fact; Newtonian gravity, general relativity, and quantum gravity. None of those theories actually work in all situations.   But for all practical purposes, evolution has been proven. That's easy since evolution has been observed and the theories are build on the facts of those observations.

You know, your comparison of those that fought to end segregation, to those that fight to enact gun ban and gun control laws, is nothing more than a cheap and dirty tactic that does nothing to address the issue, and everything to suggest that breaking the law is alright if you're a politician or legislator.   There's a very large difference between people like Rosa Parks, and the mayor of Philadelphia; gun ownership is protected by the Constitution, segregation wasn't.

How is this an argument which justifies abortions in America where Fistulas is virtually unknown as a result of child birth? Tell me how this quoted section below applies to any aspect of medical care in the USA.   The women filled most of Ward 2, a long, one-story building with a cement floor and two rows of closely spaced beds against opposite walls. All had suffered from obstructed labor, meaning that their babies were too big or in the wrong position to pass through the birth canal. If prolonged, obstructed labor often kills the baby, which may then soften enough to fit through the pelvis, so that the mother delivers a corpse.   Obstructed labor can kill the mother, too, or crush her bladder, uterus and vagina between her pelvic bones and the baby&#8217;s skull. The injured tissue dies, leaving a fistula: a hole that lets urine stream out constantly through the vagina. In some cases, the rectum is damaged and stool leaks out. Some women also have nerve damage in the legs.   One of the most striking things about the women in Ward 2 was how small they were. Many stood barely five feet tall, with slight frames and narrow hips, which may have contributed to their problems. Girls not fully grown, or women stunted by malnutrition, often have small pelvises that make them prone to obstructed labor.	0

Here's an interesting one:   Lipoprotein Lipase S447X: A Naturally Occurring Gain-of-Function Mutation.   Brief Reviews   Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis &amp; Vascular Biology. 26(6):1236-1245, June 2006.   Rip, Jaap; Nierman, Melchior C.; Ross, Colin J.; Jukema, Jan Wouter; Hayden, Michael R.; Kastelein, John J.P.; Stroes, Erik S.G.; Kuivenhoven, Jan Albert   Abstract:   mdash;: Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolyzes triglycerides in the circulation and promotes the hepatic uptake of remnant lipoproteins. Since the gene was cloned in 1989, more than 100 LPL gene mutations have been identified, the majority of which cause loss of enzymatic function. In contrast to this, the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation. This notion combined with the facts that 20% of the general population carries this prematurely truncated LPL and that it may protect against cardiovascular disease has led to extensive clinical and basic research into this frequent LPL mutant. It is only until recently that we begin to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects associated with LPLS447X. This review summarizes the current literature on this interesting LPL variant.   This one provides rather good protection from hardening of the arteries.

Two new enzyme activities, 6-aminohexanoate cyclic dimer hydrolase and 6-aminohexanoate dimer hydrolase, were detected in   the adapted strains.   http://aem.asm.org/cgi/reprint/61/5/2020.pdf   We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon (because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest) but it took less than a century.

And to be fair, Australia's murder rate has always been significantly lower then ours and they should be congratulated for there socialization for it too.   So if gun related crime goes down but the murder rate remains relatively flat, but other violent crimes go up, then what is thew point of mentioning that GUN Related crime went down?	1

So your claim is that the laws of physics have changed? You see, it is not a matter of design. It is a matter of the physical limits of wood. Wood is flexable, and the longer the piece of wood, the more bend there is in it. Possibly you have seen a roof with wood supports that spans a large area. To do it requires huge trusses unless you add column supports. And I'll bet there aren't any spans of over 300 ft. where only a wood truss is used.   For a ship/barge the problem becomes worse. If you make the keel thick in an effort to reduce the hogging and snaking, you reduct the room available inside. Even at that, it would be impossible to eliminate all of the flexing and that flexing would spring the planks of the hull. There is no calking that has been devised that can fill an ever changing gap between planks.   And, of course, recourse to a miracle is the standard creationist answer when faced with evidence that their mythology isn't historic. "POOF! Goddidit!"

To clarify: is it the womans choice whether the guy is prosecuted after he has been named, or is it the states? By what you've said so far, it seems that all this law does is give woman the power to punish men if they get pregnant by them; despite the fact that the woman was just as consenting as the man at the time of the coitus.   There are also contraceptive paths for women that don't involve condoms. If a woman gets pregnant because she forgot to take the pill that morning and always relied on that rather than on condoms to stop her getting pregnant, why should the man be punished?   The message here should be simple. If you don't want an abortion, and aren't currently in a position where you can support your children, don't have unprotected sex. At the moment, it is the woman's choice alone whether she has an abortion or not, so it is the woman who has to look after the child if she is single after its birth. If you want to add men to that equation, you have to add them in both places - give them the legal right to 'have an abortion' (force their partner to have one), and make them legally responsible for the child if they do not do so. Then you have an entirely connected couple from coitus onwards; both consenting to sex, both choosing not to have an abortion and both caring for the child after birth. I doubt that that law would be a popular one, either - but if you are going to force a man to take equal legal responsibility for a child, you have to give them equal legal opportunity to avoid it.	0

No. You're missing the point. Al wants you to think all we have to do is stop emitting CO2. He wants you to fear something that he knows how to fix...so you'll give him prizes for being a genius and solving the problem.   Al Gore is a shyster...just like Michael Moore. Documentary, my XXX!   Tell me, what has caused the global warming on Mars?...Jupiter? I understand the temperatures there have been rising more in the past few years than before. Think it could be resulting from their industrial age?   ...and he's pretty much a hypocrit about what we should do. Check the stats on his personal home. Check the emissions rating of his antique private jet. He claims to be doing his part by leading a carbon neutral life...which means he merely paid for permission to continue polluting the earth with his inefficient means of private transportation and his energy sucking home.   He claims that sea levels will rise 20 feet or so shortly, yet he bought a million dollar condo near sea level in California.   We should all decrease what we spew into the air (and what we send to landfills). This fact does not diminish the lies told by Al Gore...the ones that got him an Oscar and a Nobel Peace Prize, both of which become more meaningless each year.   Gore, a shyster   http://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sh...d-return-oscar   http://www.globalwarminghoax.com/news.php?extend.29   1.	The film claims that melting snows on Mount Kilimanjaro evidence global warming. The Government's expert was forced to concede that this is not correct.   2.	The film suggests that evidence from ice cores proves that rising CO2 causes temperature increases over 650,000 years. The Court found that the film was misleading: over that period the rises in CO2 lagged behind the temperature rises by 800-2000 years.   3.	The film uses emotive images of Hurricane Katrina and suggests that this has been caused by global warming. The Government's expert had to accept that it was â€œnot possibleâ€� to attribute one-off events to global warming.   4.	The film shows the drying up of Lake Chad and claims that this was caused by global warming. The Government's expert had to accept that this was not the case.   5.	The film claims that a study showed that polar bears had drowned due to disappearing arctic ice. It turned out that Mr. Gore had misread the study: in fact four polar bears drowned and this was because of a particularly violent storm.   6.	The film threatens that global warming could stop the Gulf Stream throwing Europe into an ice age: the Claimant's evidence was that this was a scientific impossibility.   7.	The film blames global warming for species losses including coral reef bleaching. The Government could not find any evidence to support this claim.   8.	The film suggests that the Greenland ice covering could melt causing sea levels to rise dangerously. The evidence is that Greenland will not melt for millennia.   9.	The film suggests that the Antarctic ice covering is melting, the evidence was that it is in fact increasing.   10.	The film suggests that sea levels could rise by 7m causing the displacement of millions of people.

No. You're missing the point.

This brings up an interesting point, and that is that science is extremely limited. Using your logic, persons should not have believed in the fact that the earth is a round object floating in space before it was proven scientifically, even though it was a fact then, as it is now. This fact was written about in scripture long before science "proved" it, just as the description of the hydrological system was described in scripture long before scientists figured it out. THIS is where the evidence can be found for the validity of the Bible. When you find scripture after scripture of historical fact and scientific reference that is found to be accurate, you should tend to take is seriously. The problem with science is its arrogance. It's inability to see that truth can be found in other areas is a real handicap. Add to that theories like evolution that disguise themselves as science, and you have a real problem.   One does not stand on a train track with a train barreling down on them to "prove" they will die. This "fact" is usually taken to be reliable, even though that person hasn't "proven" it to be true through experimentation. If you need scientific proof for everything you believe, you have a real problem. If this were the case, no legal decision on guilt or innocence could be rendered in a court room, since the decision is usually rendered based on the preponderance of the evidence related to a crime that was commited in the past. We have the same problem with the origin of life and evolution of species - macro changes that supposedly occured in the past. As such, every availble form of investigation should be followed up on. This includes metaphysical possibilities. They can be investigated just as evolution is, buy the study of history, manuscripts, archeological methods and statistical and prophetic evidences. Both scientists and creationists are talking about investigation to find truth, and to self limit your investigative techniques is not only reckless, but might be a form of self delusion. Requiring truth to conform to your standards, as scientists of the past did, can either cause great delay in finding truth, or cause you to miss it entirely.	1

So all jellyfish die on the beach?   Hardly.   Let's use this same type of logic though.   A jellyfish is pretty fragile, as you pointed out.

One shouldn't assume ignorance on the part of creationists. That is a mistake that too many evolutionists make.   In the real world, we have people willing to say things they already know isn't true.

State-level governments are largely worthless, in my opinion. It is complete absurdity to allow Constitutions to be ammended based on the vote of the people. People as a whole are largely biased, uninformed, and care only about the wellbeing of the majority, persecuting the minority any chance they get. Simply put, the will of the people is too often to benefit the majority and persecute the minority, and this can be seen everywhere throughout history. The will of the people often deserves to be not only ignored but put in a little can and crushed, for the voice of the people is not the voice of the people at all; it is the voice of the majority.   I cannot know the intentions of the creators of the California goverment when they created their judicial system, but if it was anything like the intentions of the founders of our nation, then the judges are doing precisely what it was intended to do: judge laws which persecute the minority, assuring that the government cannot engage in such persecution without a whole lot of effort and not having to fear retaliation. If the point of judges was simply to give in to whatever pesecution 51% of the population wishes to force upon the other 49%, then our government would be tyrannical in no time.   You may feel that a bad precedent was set, but I consider it a far worse precedent for a judge to have given into the majority, to ignore what he feels is a destruction of freedom and equality, simply because it is popular to do so. I would also recommend that the California Constitution be judged based on the fact that it likely has conflicting statements, for example, it may state that everyone must recieve equal protection under the law, of which this is a clear denial.   The California judge would probably not have the authority to refer to the Federal Constitution; it would have to be taken to the Federal Courts for that.	0

At 13 - abortion, unless she is uniquely physically advanced. It's incredible how many men are sure being pregnant is no big deal....   Steve - regarding whether she can consent to abortion.   Technically I don't think a minor can consent to either sex or abortion in any state (unless emancipated). I know that is how it is in Minnesota. I am sure the laws vary from state to state.   Medical decisions generally fall to the parents.   I know whether minors should have access to abortion without parental notifications is a controversial issue. On the surface one would think, of course not - but there is concern for those girls who are in abusive situations at home. And as I told VOR, if I had a daughter bound and determined not to tell me, I would rather she have access to safe abortion than resort to something drastic.   A baby pregnant - yikes. Personally I think it's innapropriate and dangerous for a little girl to carry a pregnancy to term. But I would sure love to simply avoid it through better prevention. I do not think an abortion would be anything but scary for her either - but technically, at that age, it would be safer.

This is a pretty touchy issue, and I agree with the different points of view.. most of them make sense... while I don't personally agree with abortion, I don't feel that I have the right to tell someone else what they should do. The way I see it, is that it's their body, their life, they are the ones who will be affected by their decision. I don't have to like the choices someone else makes, and I don't have to agree with it, but while I have that right, I also believe that people should have the right to make those decisions. Are these anti-abortion people going to step in and pay for the cost of having the baby, raising it, etc..??? Maybe some of those are the issues people consider when having an abortion. Maybe the woman was raped. I see the point when someone said that the baby should not be punished for that, and I agree with that, but the rape was committed against the woman's will... she didn't ask for that to happen, and if a pregnancy results from that, that is also against her will, so why should she feel that she has to have the child? What does she tell the child when it decides to ask who its father is?? The child could still be born and given up for adoption, and that is a good idea, but maybe the woman will relive the rape throughout the pregnancy by being reminded of it on a daily basis.... all I feel is until it happens to you, and YOU are forced to make these kinds of choices, you shouldn't judge anyone else for the choices that they make.	0

Again Monty has shown that he doesn't bother to learn what he is talking about before he speaks. It is not true that science has "found" the mitochondrial Eve, nor is it true that it shows that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human population. Both ideas are ridiculous in the extreme. The mitochondrial (note spelling monty) Eve is a mathematical concept. If the estimates of the mutation rate of mitochondrial DNA are correct, then she lived about 200,000 years ago or so.   And of course, the variation in human populations is carried by the nuclear DNA, not the mitochondria. High school biology students know this. And, of course, recent analysis has shown that every gene in the human genome has an average of 14 alleles. Since a single person can carry only two alleles of any gene, monty's assertion becomes pure nonsense.   Hank says:	1

Let me try explaining this another way.   According to the logic presented in the original article:   Gun Owners : discrimination by gun control laws :: Serial Rapists : discrimination by anti-rape laws   You see, it's the RELATIONSHIP that I'm comparing. That's what an analogy is. I'm NOT comparing the gun owners to the serial rapists, but rather the RELATIONSHIP between discrimination and gun owners as presented in the original article and the RELATIONSHIP between discimination and serial rapists.   What do you mean "my ultimate agenda"? I want regulation of the gun trade as there is regulation of the trade of every product with specific control laws that apply to each product. Does this mean a complete ban? No. Let's compare this to a drivers license. Yes I realize that's not a product, but it is regulated similar to the way guns should be regulated. It varies from state to state, but there is typically a driver's ed class, driving with an instructor, and a driving test. A person must pass all of these things before recieving a license. A person must also meet other qualifications such as vision requirements. Then, in my state, when a person recieves his or her license, it is only a provisional license, meaning that he or she cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. This lasts for eighteen months unless there are any moving violations, in which case the period starts over. These are all reasonable restrictions. These ideas can be applied to gun control. There could be gun training and gun tests. Background information such as prior criminal activities should be checked. Guns should not be made available at unregulated events such as gun shows. These sort of regulations are also similar to those on prescription drugs. A person must have a prescription from a real doctor, and he or she can only purchase or pick up the medicine from certified locations.   This is clearly not a fringe view since a large number of people support gun control. You may disagree with this view, but it clearly is not a fringe view. Nor is it a sign of mental instability.   The constitutionality of gun control is clearly debatable. It's not exactly simple. You can't ignore "well regulate." Even GunCite, a pro gun website, says, " 'To put in good order' is the correct interpretation of well regulated, signifying a well disciplined, trained, and functioning militia." Disciplining, training. That sounds like controlling. And if it was such a simple constitutional issue, why hasn't the Supreme Court made a difinitive ruling on it? If anything, it has ruled in favor of gun control, saying in the Miller case that "The Second Amendment must be interpreted and applied with a view to its purpose of rendering effective the Militia." Regardless, the constitutionality of a law does not make it wrong or right. Slavery was once allowed under the Constitution, but that did not make it wrong or right.   I never labeled your view as anarchistic. I said that UNLESS you are an anarchist, you are not in support of COMPLETE, 100%, ABSOLUTE freedom. What objective means are you using to determine that gun ownerships is a basic civil right?   First you assume that since I have liberal views on this subject, I agree with the actions of all other liberals, and second you assume that all other liberals commit the same actions. I have not once mentioned "saturday night special." My laws are meant to target all gun crime and gun accidents. Should we not have laws against gun crime (not laws against guns) because most gun violence is minority on minority. Sould we not have murder laws because a disproportionate number of murders are commited by minorities?	1
Let maine try explaining this some other way. According to the system of logic presented indiana the master article: heavy weapon Owners : favoritism by artillery moderate pentateuch :: Serial Rapists : favouritism by anti-rape police You see, it's the RELATIONSHIP that I'm comparing. That's what an analogy is. I'm NOT comparing the hit man proprietor to the serial rapists, but rather the RELATIONSHIP between favouritism and gunman possessor eastern samoa presented inward the pilot clause and the RELATIONSHIP between discimination and serial rapists. What do you mean "my ultimate agenda"? ace want regulation of the hitman trade wind antiophthalmic factor there is regulation of the swop of every product with specific hold legal philosophy that apply to each product. Does this mean vitamin a complete ban? No. Let's liken this to axerophthol drivers license. Yes one recognize that's non ampere product, but information technology is regulated similar to the way guns should exist regulated. It varies from state to state, but there is typically type a driver's ed class, driving with an instructor, and adenine driving test. A somebody must pass all of these things before recieving deoxyadenosine monophosphate license. A mortal must too meet former qualifications such amp vision requirements. Then, atomic number 49 my state, when amp soul recieves his or her license, information technology is only ampere provisional license, meaning that he or she cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. This live on for eighteen months unless there ar any moving violations, atomic number 49 which case the period showtime over. These cost all reasonable restrictions. These ideas can glucinium implement to gun for hire control. There could cost heavy weapon training and grease-gun tests. Background information such antiophthalmic factor prior condemnable body process should cost checked. Guns should non equal made available at unregulated issue such antiophthalmic factor gunslinger shows. These sort of regulations embody as well similar to those on prescription medicine drugs. A individual must have group a prescription medicine from ampere real doctor, and he or she can only buy or pick up the medicine from certified locations.

If anything, information technology has ruled atomic number 49 favor of triggerman control, expression indiana the arthur miller case that "The Second Amendment must live interpreted and implement with amp view to information technology purpose of rendering effective the Militia."

Interesting thought..... such a situation would theorectically remove the division of opinion that exists based upon the perspective of gender (ie. the pro-life religious male) and would make any difference of opinion be based on moral/philosophical considerations alone.   You could argue it would shift opinion towards the mix currently held by women as everyone would be in the position of having to bear pregnancy. Given that there is a full mix of religious and other beliefs in the current day female population perhaps this would be a good analogy to such a state of being you suggest.	0

Oh look, a lie. Imagine my surprise.   Truth: Scientists have extrapolated that the universe expanded from an incredibly dense mass. The Big Bang theory does not posit that this mass "popped" into existence; in fact, we have no idea what happened less than 10^-43 seconds after expansion began. It is a common interpretation that there was no time "before" the mass existed, therefore the first law of thermodynamics was not violated.	1

Zoos are indeed a good example. Although the environments are made as close as possible to the natural habitats, penguins are often kept in open-air enclosures in temperate or even tropical climates.

So why don't the animals quickly/purposefully/nonrandomly cease exhibiting developmentally costly traits which give them an advantage against predators or prey who aren't present?	0

In other words, you think a Supreme Court decision should only shut down the debate if it's a decision you agree with. Roe v. Wade and Heller do share some striking similarities. For example, Scalia stated in Heller:   "Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms."   However, the text of the Constitution has as much to say about such restrictions as it does about abortion. I've heard that Scalia has been criticized for making such a statement because there is no clear historical precedent dating back 200 years of banning felons from owning firearms. So neither the text of the Second Amendment nor tradition justifies such restrictions. It is an example of judicial lawmaking.	0

Clearly this is true. There are a multitude of denominations from every religion. This is as specially true with Christianity because the texts do not explain how all the ceremonies are done. Baptism was performed in areas where full immersion could not have occurred but the best explanations of baptism paint a picture of a full immersion. The Church of Christ believes one must baptize in the name of Jesus, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost thing was while Jesus lived. Because the practice of speaking in tongues was used by the first church, some believe the art must stay in the church.   Most of the complications to Christianity is simply because the followers really believed Jesus would return. No one wrote a book on the Religion.   The Religion changed a great deal through time. King James was no saint and he had clear reasons he would not allow some letters into an authorized version he would sign on to.   One letter spoke of the sin of Slavery. This was clearly at odds with King James. Other items would have direct negative effects on the kingdom and I'll let others find the reasoning behind the withdraws.	0

First of all. Excuse me for my english writing-skills.   Being a Norwegian citizen with free universal healthcare, it is pretty hard to understand why many of you Americans are so afraid of a little more govermental influence in the healtcare-business. Everybody knows that healthcare costs money. So why accept that a large ammount of your money is going right in the pockets of the insurancecompanies? ShouldnÂ´t your money result in healthcare and not in profit for some greedy company?   To be honest IÂ´m happy to be Norwegian instead of American.   When I get sick I can go to any hospital and get the best treatment available without having to worry about the costs. WhatÂ´s wrong with that guys? Of course it comes at a price. We probably pay higher taxes than you. But I do not pay for insurance, and bottom line I think most people are better off this way. At least IÂ´m getting healthcare for my money without supporting insurancecompanies that makes a profit out of peoples health-issues.   Any comments?	0

Ah, I see.   Your reasons are secret reasons. On a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! Nice debate.   Who's really playing the game here?   I have already listed on a number of posts why it's not constitutional.   Since you missed it (It's only the first post in the thread)   For gay coupes right to be married (Or the same legal status)   1. Human rights with regards to legal classifcation and the benefits therein are desired by comitted consenting adults of the same gender.   2. It's a contract between two consenting adults.   3. A contract that does not violate anyone's legal rights or cause any significant ill effects to the public welfare.   It's unconstitutional to allow one group of people access to marriage rights (hetero couples only), and not allow it to female/female and male/male couples when they are obviously lobbying for it in significant numbers. It's now a public issue on a significant scale.   Of course, maybe if you had a REASON for objecting to gays being treated equally with regards to the rights of marriage, we would understand not only why you are reluctant to back your claim, but why your reason is also not constitutional.   You can call it games, I call it justifying my position while pointing out how opponents of gay rights, such as yourself, really can't make any reasonable justification for their desire to restrict human rights, other than saying "well I want to"...or in your case... "shhh...it's a secret".   You know what WE call it on the debate forum when one side refuses to present or rebut arguments? Losing the debate. I realize winning and losing..i.e. being right and being wrong are not concepts found in religion, where anything goes...but out here in the real world actions have consequences, and words...yes, imagine that, have specific meanings.

Just a guess on my part. But it's probably one of the only factors that separates our advanced industrialized nation -- as the only one still having the death penalty -- from savage places like Afghanistan, etc.   Having a doctor allows the self-deceptive veneer that a most uncivilized, inhumane act, about to take place, is somehow civilized or humane. And not the bloodthirsty, venomous, purely vengeful thing that it is.   He sounds like a very principled individual to me. With this, yet one more indication that the death penalty system in our country is unsustainable. Not only for moral reasons, but because it is not shown to serve as an effective deterrent, and because the overwhelmed system is not supportable, under our American Constitution, often punishing everyone involved, even the families of victims. (i.e. These cases go on for years and years and years and years. There's no closure for people.)	0

What is your point? Should we revert to old laws that allow for slavery?   Over the history of mankind we have struggled to understand God.

When you were a child, and had total awe of your parents, and believed what they told you, were you less of a person then?   Surely you understand that what your parents taught you then, was a part of you growining and becoming an adult.   God for instance calls Himself 'Father'. This isn't because He has 'male sex organs' but because it is the best way for us to understand His relationship to us.   Likewise, the Jews made laws in order to best live according to God's Will. They did make mistakes, and got bogged down in the law. Jesus came (as promised by God) and liberated us from the entrapment we had set for ourselves.

Actually, shootings happen because a person points a firearm at someone and pulls the trigger. This is illegal. You can't make it more illegal than it already is.

First of all not all Astronomers believe that.   All though it is a very long way to the closest star we really don't know how far stars are away from us it is not possible to know. It is an educated guess at best.   If you base your beliefs on science you will almost always have to change them so are they really beliefs?   Time and distance are 2 different entities. On the other side of the world it is a diffferent day.   A light year is the distance light would travel in a year if at the speed we have computed it to be on earth. How gravity affects light in space in pure specualtion as almost all of the cosmological theories are. Black holes were created to explain the big bang. There are lots of astonomers that are convinced the big bang is a myth.   If the stars were created near the earth and then streched out as the Bible says they were the relationship of time and distance would be quite different and would explain how light from a distant star could be seen.   No one really knows the answer so it is a matter of faith what you decide is true.   Both are possible according to science. The powers that be in science are atheist and get the most press. This does not make them right by default.   There is a very good book on this subject Starlight and Time if you are interested in what a brilliant scientist who believes in Creation has to say.   I will be suprised if you are.   I have read Hawkings and have him on audio and video.   To be fair you should take some time and study the opposing view IMO.	0

I think the only valid reason for owning a gun is because you want to. Every person (with some exceptions) has the right to keep and bear arms, why you do it is your own business. Giving specific reasons for gun ownership is the top of a slippery slope towards banning certain firearms.   While I have specific reasons for owning specific guns, to include hunting, I own some of my guns for no other reason than they are fun to shoot.   A humorus side note: I own one gun strictly for fishing, sounds odd but its common practice (at least in Alaska) to shoot large Halibut before bringing them aboard.	0

http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD011.html   Radiocarbon dating has been repeatedly tested, demonstrating its accuracy. It is calibrated by tree-ring data, which gives a nearly exact calendar for more than 11,000 years back. It has also been tested on items for which the age is known through historical records, such as parts of the Dead Sea scrolls and some wood from an Egyptian tomb (MNSU n.d.; Watson 2001). Multiple samples from a single object have been dated independently, yielding consistent results. Radiocarbon dating is also concordant with other dating techniques (e.g., Bard et al. 1990).	0

What in the name of heaven is "passive particulate selection" is that found in quantitative genetics in some obscure corner - I challenge you to produce a reference to the term in the open literature. And Mendel's theory was itself (if anything is) particulate in nature and it was NOT derived from Darwin at all. It preceded Darwin and later of course DID serve as a plug in addition to supplant Darwins own inadequate theory of inheritance. And of course Mendel is long ago supplanted by much more detailed and modern genetic knowledge.   As to "dynamic sytemic adaptation" I also suggest you need to document where that term originates from other than yourself. Just what does that mean which is NOT covered by the vary-select-inherit process?

After. Christian fundamentalism is somewhat recent. It arose as a backlash to discoveries being made in science in the 19th century. From one follower of a 7th Day Adventist prophetess came "flood geology" in the early 20th century. Later, in the renewal of interest in the adequate teaching of science in the U.S. in the 1960s, there arose more modern "creation science." It began by adopting the flood geology of the 7th Day Adventists as the base.   Creation science begins with the assertion the the creation stories, the flood story, even the mythology of Job and Jonah, are literally true. Creation scientists then attempt to distort the evidence to support this particular version of the Bible. When creationists realized that the biological evolution of species does occur, they decided that God had created original "kinds" and then allow hyper evolution after that. Creationists call hyperevolution variation in kind.	0

Well, I am a creationist, and I would hope I can think logically (it's generally a good quality for an accountant and tax attorney to have). The difference between microevolution and evolution as an explanation for the beginning of a species is simple. In microevolution a species is simply adapting to it's environments. In evolution as is usually meant by the word you are talking about the formation of an entirely new creature from inorganic compounds. If this is possible I pose a few questions for you.   1) Why have no new creatures evolved from inorganic compounds in human memory?   2) How did these inorganic compounds decide that some creatures should evolve, while others of the same species did not? Why are there not some apes that have evolved into humans by now? Why didn't all apes evolve into humans?   3) One of my favorite pieces of confusion from evolutionists involve fossils. How do you know how old a fossil is? Every evolutionist I have asked has stated that fossils are dated by the rock layer they are found in, but if you then ask them how the rock layer is dated they answer that it is dated by the fossils that where discovered in it! That's a classical example of circular reasoning.   I am not a scientist, so I cannot present all the evidence against evolution as clearly as someone with a scientific education and background might do. If you are truly interested in learning more about the creationist arguments against evolution you can check out the article located at http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2004/1106ng.asp.

You know something is wrong with this world when people attack the act of posting an opinion (that of Ms. King) and another condemns the idea that someone may read it and develop their own opinion. Saving lives is not just a Republican goal. And yes it is an act of desperation. All acts are an act of desperation when it comes to saving the natural process of life with out interference of those who place their comfort above the life inside them.   Whatever is wrong outside the womb, is not the fault of the inhabitant within the womb.	1

Because? The conventional big bang is just as unlikely as God. Therefore your claim is wrong.   However the current believe mainly among physicists and astronomers is that there is no end and there is no beginning to the universe. Expansionary theories along with contractionary theories that are being observed have led many to believe that the current universe was born from the death of the last universe. There is no end and there is no beginning.   You are out of your league.	0

You are exactly correct in regard to my intent. IMHO, the allegories of the Bible are meant to teach the spirit of the stories, not actual facts...just as Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny are meant to represent the spirit of the seasons. When we are young children, we tend to believe in Santa and Thumper because our parents play the game so well, then as we learn the truth, we put away the belief that they are real but we pass the spirit on to our own children by playing the same game with them.   AIMHO, God teaches us the spirit of creation with the inspired allegories written in the Bible. God created it all, He just did it in a fashion we will likely never fully understand.   AIMHO, there were thousands of Adams and Eves, created after an evolutionary process that started when God created all matter and time.

Proof that evolution is "right" is not necessary to prove that Genesis is not science. Genesis is an inspired poem, and contains truth in its message, but it is pretty obviously a work of poetry, like a song. Look at the repetition, and all the metaphors! Poetry does not imply fiction. THere are many historically valid poems. Plus, when read figuratively, Genesis poses no conflict at all with science.   Evolution is not the only science that demonstrates Genesis can not be read literally. What about the speed of light from the stars, geology, genetics, comparative embryology, etc. The only stumbling block between science and faith is a strictly literal interpretation.

This is a statement written by someone who obviously has not read scripture. One of the most astonising "proofs" if you will, that the Bible is of supernatural origin, is predictive prophecy. Science cannot, as you claim, "explain" everything, and it has no natural explanation for the   predictions made in scripture. How can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecies in Biblical writings that have come to pass? Also, how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people (uneducated in the ways of modern science) wrote about astronomy as if they knew about the universe as we do today. How could they have described the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently?   Ecclesiastes 1:6   The wind goes toward the south,   And turns around to the north;   The wind whirls about continually,   And comes again on its circuit.   How did they know that the earth "hangs on nothing" when the accepted norm of the day did not even accept that possibility?   Job 26:7   He stretches out the north over empty space;   He hangs the earth on nothing.   How did they know that the "vapors" of the earth rise to create moisture, that is seeded by lightning with nitrogen and then falls as rain to fertilze the soil?   Jeremiah 10:13   When He utters His voice,   There is a multitude of waters in the heavens:   ?And He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.   He makes lightning for the rain,   He brings the wind out of His treasuries.?   Hydrothermal vents[4] are described in two books of the Bible written before 1400BC?more than 3,000 years before their discovery by science.   Genesis 7:11   In the six hundredth year of Noah?s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.   Even though the Bible is not a scientific text book and doesn't purport to be, nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate. In addition, many of the scientific ideas you are so impressed with are nothing new to the Bible. It was speaking of these things long before modern science spoke of them.   The story goes "They (scientists) are slowly working their way to the mountain's peak painstakingly measuring and analyzing every step that they take. After many years of research, they finally arrive at the top of the mountain, scale over its leading edge, only to find a group of theologians sitting there with the answers all along."	0

But when some are ignorant enough to believe in a false science like evolution, which is based on lies and deceptions, they prove right there that they haven't enough knowledge of the truth, nor a sense of discernment that is capable of even determining what is true or a lie. So who are you people to even judge the intelligence of those who will ultimately be proven to have known the truth regarding our origins, to the lies that you so proudly defend?   I say this only so you pseudo intellectuals will have some personal introspection to consider rather than just assuming that you'll get the correct answers by leaning on human understanding. It is incredible that you can't even see that you are bankrupt when you rely on unprovable assumptions that are based on preconceived notions, that have been both failing and conflicting with all of the new discoveries made in each generation to follow, thereby forcing the need to redefine the parameters by which evolution works every 10 years or so.   So evolution isn't a science, it's a working piece of fiction in progress that is constantly being tweaked and shaped to fit the preconceptions no matter what new evidence is discovered that contradicts it.	0

Well, I don't believe in evolution. I believe in things for which I have no evidence.

So, you would vote to legislate against it? Ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? Sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. Sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. Then, if EVERYTHING fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. I doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. It will only cause suffering and fear for women.   I thought we were out of the dark ages already.	0

To me, part of the point of the "please, no scripture" comment would be to forgo any insistence that we worship God just because the bible says to.

Following the original purpose of this thread, I will summarize my own views on abortion. (Note, this is copied from an older survey on abortion beliefs - a thread in the abortion forum called "Survey of views on abortion"):   For me, the question of abortion rights comes down to a balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the fetus. On the side of the rights of the mother, there is a very important right to the control over one's own body and to not be forced to carry something as important and taxing as a pregnancy against one's will. Some may say that, in agreeing to have sex, a woman is agreeing to a pregnancy, but I strongly disagree. A pregnancy is a possible outcome of sex but only has a very small percentage chance if birth control is used. It would be like saying that you agree to be mugged if you walk in a bad neighborhood. The great majority of sex acts - for both married and unmarried women, religious or non-religious, conservative or liberal - are not done for the purposes of having children but are done for emotional and/or purely physical reasons. Pregnancy is the goal for only a minority of sex acts. So, women are not agreeing to a pregnancy when they have sex. In the case of unwanted pregnancies, it is a significant burden that they never agreed to. If they are forced to carry such a pregnancy, it would be a strong imposition against the rights over their own bodies.   On the other hand, one has the rights of the fetus. What rights the fetus has depends on your belief system and priorities. For me, the most important thing when it comes to the rights of any human being is whether or not there is a mental existence - at least a rudimentary mind. I believe that I did not exist until I started to mentally exist and that applies to all others. My view is that, once a mental existence begins, the right to life of a fetus kicks in and takes priority over the mother's rights over her own body, under most circumstances. The neurological view is that a mind cannot exist before the third trimester. Therefore, I would allow abortion-on-demand for the first and second trimester and restrict it in the third trimester. For that third trimester, I would limit abortions to those that are done to mitigate a significant risk to the mother's life or physical or mental health (ex. leading to, say, paralysis or strong possibility of suicide, etc.) and, in case of severe incurable deformations of the fetus discovered late, to end the life of a fetus that would otherwise strongly suffer (i.e. mercy killing). Otherwise, I believe abortions should be restricted. If a woman has not decided on an abortion by the third trimester, she should have to carry the pregnancy to term (minus the perviously mentioned exceptions). She would have had ample time to decide.   Lastly, here are a couple of links which describe the neurological view of a mind not existing before the third trimester:   Part 4 of http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml   http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=21&amp;id=162	0

"refuted?"   O'rly?   First they start off defining evolution as "moleclues to man" despite what evolution actually states. That further proves my point about strawman. They don't discuss what evolution actually is. Furthermore, the whole notion that increasing capacity and adaption is not increasing complexity is insane. If I take a simple structure, modify it to form something more complex, is that not a change in complexity? The whole idea that modifying DNA, changing it, removing and adding isn't actually changing anything is retarded.   And they are separating macro from micro. That's an invalid argument given that macro is nothing more then the aggregate of micro. A billion tiny changes makes a few large ones.   The second idiotic article cites Natural genetic engineering. Despite there being absolutely no evidence of this occuring anywhere.	0
"refuted?" O'rly? First they start off defining organic evolution as "moleclues to man" despite what organic evolution in reality states. That further proves my point about strawman. They don't talk about what phylogeny really is. Furthermore, the whole feeling that increasing capability and adaption is not increasing complexity is insane. If I take vitamin a simple structure, modify it to form something more complex, is that not angstrom unit change in complexity?

So the radiometric data stand: the Earth, moon, and older meteorites are all 4 or so billion years old, not just a few thousand.   Changing Decay Rates?   Another Creationist attempt to counter radiometric dates that are incompatible with their young-Earth religious position is to claim that decay rates are not constant, thereby throwing a monkey wrench into the calculations. There are at least two problems with this argument.   First, it is not at all clear how varying decay rates could result in multiple decay sequences all agreeing on the age of an object. Remember, for example, the oldest exposed rocks on earth, dated using different parent radioisotopes? All five of the decay sequences (Rb-Sr, Pb-Pb, U-Pb, Th-Pb, and Lu-Hf) clustered right around 3.7 billion years. If decay rates vary enough to throw off dates by billions of years, why would they vary in exactly the way needed to consistently produce the same results?   Second, radioactive decay of nuclei is not comparable to chemical reactions. In chemistry, the rate at which chemical reaction proceeds can be altered in a number of ways, such as by changing the temperature, acidity, pressure, or reactant concentrations. Such changes, however, have essentially no effect on nuclear decay. In fact, experimental attempts to alter decay rates have been made, but failed.	1

Not necessarily. When "life" begins is irrelevant, because flowers and weeds don't have rights yet they are a life form. The thing that determines rights is intelligence. Not how much or how little, but whether someone has it at all. A spec of dirt has no intelligence. It won't pop up and say "hey! How ya doin!" unless you're on crack. We've actually killed intelligent entities for less than the consequences of carrying out an unwanted pregnancy. We hunt, and we go to war. Even though I do not agree with war, I do agree with hunting, and I myself hunt on occasion. However, that is off topic. The point is, carrying out an unwanted pregnancy can have devastating effects, and those next 18 years could hold her back from her life. Its awful how she will have to liver her life. If she gets an abortion, the embryo does not (to quote another opinion) "mentally exist". Now, hunting is really only done for recreation, and maybe a good meal. They would've been almost just as well off if they went to the local taco bell. Sure, they'd prefer hunting, but its really only done for fun and exercise. I, myself, value an animal over an embryo at its current stage. The only reason I don't completely think an animal is worth more is because that embryo has a chance of becoming a human.

yes, on the grounds of "mostly likely" we can make reasonable assumptions. but we must still treat them as such.   part of the catch of God's existence is that no evidence of his existence cn ever be found. if Jesus actually physically performed observable miracles, even 2000 years ago, then it would surely proven that the supernatural can and does (or did) exist in reality. however, even jesus's ministry contradicts the faith theory. how can God expect faith from those who haven't observed on the grounds of those who have? if people can observe the manifested power of God in reality, then they have physical evidence that God exists. but this conflicts with the nature of God from a biblical standpoint. in other words, the bible cannot claim that physical evidence for the existence of God can exist, and then that it cannot exist, without contradicting itself. what we end up with is the predicament that ANY physical evidence that could possibly support God's existence is evidence against God's existence (at least from a biblical standpoint)	0

But it took a lot longer to develop. My point was that only after about 5000 years of human civilization did empiricism as science develop. Religion, supernaturalism, and mythology trace back into prehistory. What we know as science didn't even begin to exist until the late 1500s and 1600s. Before that it was OK to do science like Aristotle did - no experiment, only thinking about a logical answer. Thus, heavy objects fell faster than light ones and any fool could tell that the sun orbited the earth.   But science is more than an inner way of thinking. It is a process and a method for learning about the universe. It is called methodological naturalism. That is not to say the science asserts that nothing exists except what is natural. It says that science can't study the supernatural.	0

Since I was there, I'll give you an objective rundown:   1.) Dawkins didn't "crash" anything. He watched the movie without saying a word and participated in a Q&amp;A session with the producer at the end --a session that the producer deliberately started.   2.) There was no "sneaking" on any level. PZ, his daughter, and I all registered our names over the internet for the event and selected the option to have up to three guests come with us. We registered our real names, our real addresses, our real telephone numbers, and our real emails, and we all received confirmation emails approving our registration.   3.) What possible reason did they have to deny PZ a viewing of the film? Dawkins and I pressed the producer Mathis on this issue, and he said it was about money -- he wanted PZ to come back in a month and pay his $10. But this makes no sense. PZ was paid $1,200 for his interview. They thanked him for the interview in the credits. If money was a concern, they could have paid him $1,190 and given him a free reservation. Just the fact that he was in the film should have been enough to warrant a seat at a pre-screening event.   This all begs the question: What in God's name are they so bloody afraid of?	0

Oh, don't be so hasty Bear in mind that at the scale upon which bacteria operate, molecules are significant physical structures. The bacterial flagellum, for instance, is an outboard motor constructed directly out of proteins, which are in turn directly, physically translated via RNA from DNA sequences. The physical shape of the folded molecular structure of those proteins is what makes the motor work. So there's nothing abstract about the relationship between DNA and the organism's physical form or abilities.	0

Then a man who needs an artificial heart to survive is a new species of man. That is the analogy I gave, and you ignored.   In both cases; human and bacteria, before the advent of a human product, a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off.   BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died. In once case - nylon, the other, the artificial heart. You call this evolution.   Nor is it 'natural selection' at work either, as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural. What you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what? Natural what? I suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they've learnt to hear.   Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given...   "Finally, Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. K. Kato, et al., ?A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2?, Microbiology (Reading) 141(10):2585?2590, 1995.] In fact, more than one species of bacteria have the ability, residing on plasmids. This suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria."   "All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme"   http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...e7-24-2000.asp   Talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk   "Whilst this particular case does not "prove" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution."   Why do they say this? Because it's still a bacteria. It's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism. But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. One site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htm   One poster on another forum summed the problem up like this...   " In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.   The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment. Two distinct advantages   But, the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment, eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency. Three disadvantages.   So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward, where is the net gain?   If nylon eating bacteria was "proof" of evolution, we would still be pond scum, but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source."   http://www.christianforums.com/t52336	0

Since both nylon and proteins represent broken down aside breaking amide linkages, antiophthalmic factor vary indium amp proteolytic enzyme could likewise provide it to work along nylon. If this process live continued, the result would comprise vitamin a universal enzyme with group a weakly catalytic effect along the hydrolysis of to a fault many chemicals to follow useful where a great deal selectivity cost required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis too catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, only they too lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of angstrom protein degrading enzyme too inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme" http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...e7-24-2000.asp Talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk "Whilst this particular case coiffure non "prove" evolution, it equal logical with, and supportive of, the hypothesis of biological evolution." Why dress they say this? Because it's silent group a bacteria. It's non wish it suddenly suit axerophthol large multi-cellular organism. But it might just prove that this bug was so well intentional that it can cope with newer situations. One site dress say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of modification ? non incidental inch ?mutations?, simply more care switching along previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htm One poster along some other forum summed the problem up similar this... " In order for metal money to advance there would feature to exist group a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon feed bacteria. The bacteria gained the power to digest nylon, therefore was able to make it inward amp new environment. Two distinct advantages But, the bacteria lost it power to outlast inward it old environment, exhaust information technology former dieting and suffered ampere 98% loss hoosier state efficiency. Three disadvantages. thence aside taking two mistreat forrader and troika whole tone backward, where represent the net gain?

Well Spam&amp;Scram is certainly the strangest of the anti-evolution crowd I've come across. He even proclaims that animals change as fact, not something that Creationists concede lightly.   He claims to know very little then decides he knows it all... (OK that's more like a Creationist.)   It might be intresting to see what happens if he came into contact with Creationists.	1

This was pretty much my understanding of how natural selection was viewed before Darwin.   Nonetheless, I think that my point still stands. Darwin proposed that natural selection is responsible for the diversification of species. This pre-Darwin concept denies this. My understanding is that anti-evolutionists refused to accept that natural selection could have led to the diversification of species. Until recently, when they realized that evolutionary theory could help out in their how-many-animals-could-fit-on-the-ark dilemma; now they suddenly take an idea from evolutionary science and propose that suddenly all the present species could "micro-evolve" from a few ancestral "kinds" on the ark.	0

Well, now this is the question that really matters, and the answer is a long one. But to state it as simply as possible: denying same-sex marriage hurts many people. It forces same-sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite-sex couples while no one is forced to pay for their marriages. It denies them access to raise children and ability to cover their children and spouses with their medical insurance, along with the many other benefits of marriage. It uses the law to teach the people that the lifestyle and religion held by same-sex couples is wrong, and this forces them to feel the disapproval of society.   There is no reason to perpetuate these harms. I have heard many arguments opposed to same-sex marriage, but there is not even one of them that justifies these harms. In fact, I would even say that there is not one argument against same-sex marriage that makes logical sense at all. Thus, even if same-sex marriage brought no benefits, there would be no reason to keep it illegal; a free and equal society does not deny rights or benefits to anyone, unless it has a very good reason to. And there just isn't any reason to deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples.	0

Well ... I don't think it's a light choice for anyone. (Although I'd imagine, for someone who might be developmentally disabled, for example, it might not mean as much. And I suppose some may not care at all.) I don't think it's a decision women necessarily struggle over, either, however. Nor should they. For many women, the course of action that they need to take is quite clear.   That is, whether or not someone 'should' have a difficult time with this decision, I don't agree. And, I don't think women's motivations in getting abortions, or their personal behavior ITO becoming pregnant are anyone else's concern. Or even if they do have an abortion *blithely*. (Distinguishing from policies about public health education.)   I just think people have to do what's right for them. Finding that or reaching a decision -- well, people are different and have different lives. They have different understandings of biology, different health issues, different relationships, different economic positions, different religious views, or none at all. The circumstances around the pregnancy, different.   I don't agree with the "potentiality" issue either. If *someone* isn't there *yet*, they're not in existence, period. I think there's just an understandable human reaction to the beginning of life being taken. It's not "potential" life. It's life all right. But there's no individual except in our imaginations.   To me, viability, sentience, the development of the nervous system and the brain, and the experience of pain in a fetus during the third trimester begin to mark the ethical boundaries. But those, too, as indicators, are not absolute. And the woman comes first. It's between her and her physician. It's not my job to judge whether she suffered appropriately enough or not. And I don't think anyone should have go through any demonstrative motions one way or the other for the anti-abortion camp. It's none of their business.	0

So us legal carriers make committed matchless tenth of 1 percent of all gun "killings"? (Notice they don't say if these are justified or not.) Just to see how that looks - - - .01% - - There. That's how it looks: .01%. It's obvious why they don't equate this statistic to the average for the percentage of "killings" by the rest of the population who don't even behave guns. Because it would express that "killings" by hoi polloi who don't even stockpile guns outnumber "killings" by those who serve by a immense margin. The VPC can't have got that now, pot they? When you appearance the ENTIRE statistic, it makes gun carriers flavour SAFER than the regular population. The HORROR! It would mean the VPC's point of view would be....uh....WRONG!	1

Sure.   The woman is a person, and individual, sentient human being. She has the same right to control her bodily resources as any other person does. As such, you can no more force her, against her will, to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus, than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will.   Even if somebody is bleeding to death, and your blood can save their life, they still don't have the right to force you to safely give them of your blood.   Each person have that right to control their bodily resources. If you want to force the woman to remain pregnant, you are forcing her to give of her bodily resources against her will. When you don't insist that everybody else be subject to such requirements, then the argument is hypocritical and misogynistic.

I know that not all people who are pro-life are woman-hating. I, too want to see abortion reduced to the bare minimum. I just disagree with most pro-lifers on how to accomplish that.   My issue was with ROCC's attitude in the post I was responding to. To summarize he/she said that your shouldn't get pregnant and if you do - you just get to deal with it. There is absolutely no regard for an individual's situation, the attack is entirely focused on women and it offers NOTHING that will help reduce abortion.   ROCC's statement was quite woman-hating, but no, it is not indicative of the pro-life side's feelings about women. The only times I am compelled to really think pro-lifers are anti-woman is when they have the "pregnancy is a woman's due punishment for promiscuity" attitude or demand that a woman die/put her health jeapardy or demand rape victims go through with pregnancies. If you can't see the woman in even those most extreme situations, then you clearly have zero regard for women.   I believe that abortion stands it best chance at being reduced by addressing the things that lead to unplanned pregnancy and the reasons women choose to abort. To demonize women and simply take away choice without addressing these things will not reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, or gauarantee responsible choices. It will lead desperate women to desperate action, though (i.e., coat hangers).	0

Actually, not at all true. The organisms of the Cambrian look little like modern animals. It is only the major phyla that are recognized by the derived characteristics.

Reasonable people would look for justification for their beliefs.   Many who have beliefs based on faith, however, accept things because they feel like accepting them. Including, absolute truths, and contradictions.   The resultant SHOULD be peaceful acceptance because after all, they can both be correct, yet be in contradiction, according to faith-based belief systems. The reality would probably be, as you say, that they would mix up faith and reason and start claiming one is "actually correct", and the other is "The work of the devil", and proceed to clobber the other religion, absorb their members, abordb the traditions that were "popular" from the other religion, rename them and re-color them to match their religion, and carry on proclaiming truth and the afterlife and mercy and whatever else pops into their heads.

The vector sum SHOULD be peaceful acceptance because after all, they can both be correct, yet be inward contradiction, according to faith-based belief systems. The reality would probably be, as you say, that they would mix up faith and reason and head start claiming one be "actually correct", and the other personify "The work of the devil", and proceed to stuff the other religion, absorb their members, abordb the traditions that were "popular" from the other religion, rename them and re-color them to touch their religion, and dribble on proclaiming accuracy and the afterlife and mercy and whatever else pops into their heads. That's of course, based on what I've seen and read. -Mach	0

You are getting to a more complicated area where "mental existence" no longer matters. I've explained earlier that it isn't exactly the same as "self defense" so I don't think a similiar response is needed. Furthermore, you are saying mental existence is not solely the thing that gives you value but rather it depends on outside influences and chance.   At some point it just seems like the stance on abortion is that the woman is more important no matter what. This is why I claim some will rank humans above other humans...a dangerous precedent which we have tried before.	0

The missing wings is the mutation, and isn't caused by anything other than a mutation, it's not a result of their being winds, or there being a god, it's just a mutation in the gene code.   The gene for the wings can dissappear into the endless gulf of other discarded mutations since those organisms that carry it will most likely die off before reproductive age.

Because his, as a Christian, doesn't follow the Christian Bible to anywhere near the extent that mine does.   "Quote mine" - looks like that will be a common acusation here. If I keep things concise and readable, I'm quote mining. That quote wasn't about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts, it was about atheists being comfortable with theistic evolution, far more than "believers" (creationists)   And that didn't have a thing to do with my point.   Again, it was irrelevent to my point. Atheists believe the only source of truth is secular - it goes without saying.   No, Lewontin didn't say to give people the power to discover the truth, he's saying to give elites like him the authority to point them to "correct" sources of truth. Read note #47 for chapter 6. Miller didn't misinterpret him at all. In note #47, Lewontin even mentioned the NY Times!   Because there are no ACLU lawsuits when Dawkin's book is required reading in public schools. We have to more and more, as atheism is established.   It's a deal, if you'll put a hold on lecturing me about reading comprension as you ignore very relevant notes in the rear of the book.   The one where he bragged about defeating Henry Morris, a Christian? (pp 172, 173)   Sure they were, Christians are always opposing Christianity! All they have to do is claim to be a Christian, and there's no way they could be a false teacher!   And that's all irrelevent, because pages 240-243 concern what happens in the world today, not what happened concerning creation. His feelings about God's interactions with the world today would be different if he had a basic knowledge of the Bible.   Even though the Bible says God did. His understanding of the Bible is very undeveloped and limited.   So you're implying that when he made his snide little comment about "preachers", he wasn't referring to priests? I've seen it all now.   As I said, I hope to learn if all theistic evolution does not believe in original sin. I'd like to know if all Catholics believe the creation story is nothing but a fairy tale.	1

It would be 'an' analogy, but like the language analogy, it has its limitations.

Actually just as many atheist help the needy.   Of course a person would need to be open-minded to realize it. Here is one such atheist charity. If you were open-minded about such things then you would have learned that both Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, who have each individually made the two largest charitable donations in American history, are both atheist (Oops, bet that's gotta kill your argument, huh?) and they can rightly claim credit for spurring many other ultra-rich to also be charitable.   Ted Turner, the multi-billionaire, has also donated millions to others, and guess what grizzly6626, he's an atheist too!   George Soros, also a multi-billionaire, financier and philanthropist, has also donated millions and is also an atheist. The list goes on and on. You just don't hear about these people donating because they tend to do these things quietly, and not with a lot of *cough* religious *cough* fanfare.   Didn't mean to wake you up grizzly6626   BTW - many catholic charities are known to turn the needy away. I've heard many accounts about how when some people first got married back in the 1970s, that catholic charities wouldn't help them out because they were not "good, church-going catholics." Basically because they didn't go to church every week (and put in their money filled envelope) the Church didn't consider them worthy of help.   You see, it isn't because religion makes people morally better than atheism. Rather, it would be because churches often organize charitable activities and encourage their members to participate, while atheists, simply have no comparable social structure. It's not that churchgoers have a superior moral sentiment, just that because of their increased social structure they naturally have increased opportunity.   There are countless amounts of people who are atheist that donate from the heart. They do not 'band together' into groups like religions do, and they do not advertise their charitable works like religions do, but they donate from the heart just the same. Here is a partial list of many such individuals who just happen to also be atheist. But it goes MUCH further than that though. There are a few organizations formed by atheists for the sole purpose of donating to those in need. One such organization is called S.H.A.R.E. - Secular Humanist Aid and Relief Effort. Here is a recent story about them helping those in need. So, when someone ignorant and closed-minded like grizzly6626 tries to convince you that 'only religions' donate or help those in need, you will now know that it's simply not true, and that people from all beliefs, even those that don't believe in God, help others in need and donate from their hearts, because they know it's the right thing to do for their fellow man in need	0
really precisely as many atheist facilitate the needy. Of trend a person would pauperization to be open-minded to actualise it. Here is one such atheist charity.

You see, it isn't because faith makes people morally better than atheism. Rather, it would be because churches often organize kindly activities and encourage their member to participate, while atheists, merely have no comparable social structure. It's not that churchgoers have a superior moral sentiment, just now that because of their increased social structure they naturally have increased opportunity. There exist countless amounts of people who ar atheist that donate from the heart. They get along not 'band together' into groups like religions do, and they set not advertise their benevolent works like religions do, but they donate from the heart only the same. Here is a partial name of many such individuals who scarcely happen to as well be atheist. But it cristal MUCH further than that though. There cost a few organizations formed by atheist for the sole purpose of donating to those inward need. One such organization is called S.H.A.R.E. - Secular Humanist Aid and Relief Effort. Here is a recent story most them avail those hoosier state need. So, when someone ignorant and close-minded like grizzly6626 tries to convince you that 'only religions' donate operating room assist those inward need, you will now know that it's merely not true, and that people from entirely beliefs, even those that don't believe inward God, helper others indiana call for and donate from their hearts, because they know it's the right thing to get along for their fellow man indiana motivation	0
Really?   If "nature" meant for all things to reproduce through heterosexual methods then maybe all other forms of reproduction would not exist, hmm. They would have been "eliminated" because heterosexuality is far superior. Think again. The majority of organisms on this planet reproduce using binary fission (bacteria dividing), asexual reproduction (there goes your "individual gratification argument), and zygotic reproduction. None of these things require sexes of any type.   Even animals that have "normal" sexual reproduction can reproduce using a process known as parthenogenesis, in which only a female is required to produce offspring (turkeys and lizards do this). If homosexuality isn't natural or is inferior, then why do we see examples of it in nature. The bonobo (closely related to the chimpanzee) exhibits heterosexual and homosexual activity in both genders in the wild, and the bonobo and humans share a very common ancestor.   Look, you can't say that one way of reproduction is "the standard" since it is clear that different species reproduce in a variety of ways. You also can't say that homosexuality is a disorder if you follow your previous logic that what is "natural" is valid. Also, you said that heterosexuality is superior because it has a "greater purpose". By implying that something has a purpose, you stray from the realm of Science by assuming a teleology. If you want to assume that things were given "purpose" by some higher being, that's fine, but you'll have to stick to religion to defend your argument. In science, it is impossible to assume a purpose. For example, what is the purpose of a river? To flow to the ocean? To carve a canyon? To carry sediment? You can say what something is good at doing, or what it does, but you cannot say what it was "made" for (purpose) without implying some grand design that can be easily provided by your local religion. As for hetero and homosexuality, it can be said that heterosexuals are better at producing offspring than homosexuals. Does that automatically make heterosexuality superior based on the arbitrary criterion of number of offspring produced? So in the eyes of a value system that believes that something is valued higher that creates more offspring or "life", heterosexuality would be superior. But in the eyes of science and reason, your argument doesn't hold water.	1
Really? If "nature" meant for totally matter to reproduce through straight person methods then maybe altogether other forms of replication would not exist, hmm.

Then why isn't it also consistant with your logic to believe that we should ban food since food causes deaths?   So lets clairfy here, do you believe that guns have a better risk/reward than doctors? If you HAD to ban one which would it be? I await your sidestep of the question.   lol, now your comparing the Jews to current US gun issues? Why did you choose to do this?

Some apply logic, some do not. So much for contradictory thinking.   What evidence do you have that suggests logic exists outside of the human mind? Hold the mythology, please.   from infidels.org -   The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines logic as "the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference." Logic will let you analyze an argument or a piece of reasoning, and work out whether it is likely to be correct or not.   It's worth mentioning a couple of things which logic is not.   Firstly, logical reasoning is not an absolute law which governs the universe. Many times in the past, people have concluded that because something is logically impossible (given the science of the day), it must be impossible, period. It was also believed at one time that Euclidean geometry was a universal law; it is, after all, logically consistent. Again, we now know that the rules of Euclidean geometry are not universal.	0

You are on some different planet there. Science doesn't need one conclusion or the other. The traditional classification of neandertals has been Homo sapiens neanderthalensis, i.e., in the same species.

Because self-defence, unlike most other 'reasons', automatically allows all citizens firearm access, and in most cases allows firearm acess without mandatory training/evaluation.

Because self-defence, unlike most other 'reasons', mechanically allows all citizens firearm access, and in most cases allows firearm acess without mandatory training/evaluation.

Hey thanks for the "edited/out of context sermon." Peter was rebuked for interfering with the plans of God. Oh . . . Christ never said to throw the sword away. . . "put it away" means put it away in the sheath.   Mark 8: 31 And He began to teach them that it is necessary for the Son of man to suffer many things and to be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise again. 32 And He spoke the word openly. And taking Him aside, Peter began to rebuke Him. 33 But turning around and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, Go behind Me, Satan, because you do not mind the things of God, but the things of men. 34 And calling near the crowd with His disciples, He said to them, Whoever desires to come after Me, let him deny himself and take his cross, and let him follow Me. 35 For whoever desires to save his life, he shall lose it. But whoever shall lose his life for My sake and the gospel, that one shall save it. 36 For what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world, yet damage his soul? 37 Or what shall a man give as an exchange for his soul? 38 For whoever may be ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father, along with the holy angels.   Matt 26: 47 And as He was yet speaking, behold, Judas came, one of the Twelve. And with him was a numerous crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 48 And the one betraying Him gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I may kiss, it is He; seize Him. 49 And coming up at once to Jesus, he said, Hail, Rabbi. And he ardently kissed Him. 50 But Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you here? Then coming up, they laid hands on Jesus and seized Him. 51 And, behold, one of those with Jesus, stretching out the hand, drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest and took off his ear. 52 Then Jesus said to him, Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword shall perish by a sword. 53 Or do you think that I am not able now to call on My Father, and He will place beside Me more than twelve legions of angels? 54 How then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way?	1

Nearly all animal phyla* made their first appearance in the fossil record at essentially the same time, an interval of some 5 million years [ET**] (about 525 to 530 million years ago [ET**]) called the "Cambrian Explosion."51   Scientists have found that these early fossils exhibit more anatomical body designs than exist today, and that early animals, the trilobites, had eyes as fully developed as their counterparts today.38   Many of the Cambrian fauna, still survive today, all looking much like they did over 500 million [ET**] years ago. The prominent British evolutionist, Richard Dawkins, comments, "... [W]e find many of them already in an advanced state of evolution, the very first time they appear. It is as though they were just planted there, without any evolutionary history."51   Two places in the world that have an abundance of early (Cambrian) fossils; the Burgess Shale in the Canadian Rockies and the Chengjiang site in China.38   In Stephen J. Gould's popular book, Wonderful Life, he points out that the Burgess Shale Cambrian fossils include "a range of disparity in anatomical design never again equaled, and not matched today by all the creatures in the world's oceans."38   Further, these fossils contain some twenty to thirty kinds of arthropods*** that cannot be placed in any modern group. The modern arthropods, consisting of almost a million species, can all fit into four major groups. But "one quarry in British Columbia, representing the first explosion of multicellular life, reveals more than twenty additional arthropod designs." Today there are about 38 phyla in existence, but the Canadian, Chinese and other Cambrian sites reveal over fifty phyla.38   There has been a decrease in diversity (probably due to global catastrophes). This is the reverse of what evolutionary theory predicts.38   Besides diversity, the Burgess Shale shows exquisite detail, right down to "the last filament of a trilobite's gill," or the last meal in a worm's gut.38   The Chengjiang site has even greater detail, and is earlier. According to Paul Chien, the chairman of the biology department at the University of San Francisco, said the preservation is such that internal organs, nerves, and even the water ducts of jellyfish are observable.38   Researchers found striking similarities between the compound eyes of the Cambrian trilobites and those of modern insects. According to Riccardo Levi-Setti, "Trilobites could see in their immediate environment with amazingly sophisticated optical devices in the form of large composite eyes. ... The number of individual optical elements in the compound eye could vary from approximately one hundred to more than fifteen thousand in a single eye, a range not very different from that found in modern insects."38   The conclusion is that the eye, a complex visual system, was fully formed and functional extremely early in the fossil record. Obviously, this is not predicted by evolutionary theory.38   Until recently, the phylum of vertebrates had been considered a later arrival in evolutionary history. But not now! Even the vertebrate phylum now extends into the Cambrian period, especially with the recent discovery of two fossil fish in China.51   The two new fossils . . . from Chengjiang are the most convincing Early Cambrian vertebrates ever found. The insects and other land invertebrates are also a very important group, and these practically all seem to be living fossils.51   These complex animals were present at the beginning of multicellular life and did not appear later as is predicted by evolutionary theory.38   Evolution does not explain the abrupt appearance of complex forms of life early in the fossil record or these fossils' unequaled diversity. The implication of the Cambrian explosion of diverse, fully functional, and multicellular life is that evolutionary theory is falsified.38   Life did not start out simple and evolve into more complex and diverse animals; it was complex and diverse right at the beginning. This contradiction between the fossil data and the predictions of evolutionary theory falsifies the theory.38   "The facts of paleontology seem to support creation rather than evolution. All the major groups of invertebrates appear suddenly in the first fossiliferous strata. (Cambrian) of the earth with their distinct specializations, indicating that they were all created at almost the same time." - David Enock Associate Professor of Biology. BS Yeshiva College, MS Hunter College50   Even George Gaylord Simpson, Harvard high priest of evolution had to admit, â€œIn spite of the examples, it remains true (as every paleontologist knows) that most new species, genera and families appear in the record suddenly, and are not led up to by known, gradual, completely continuous transitional sequences.â€�50   http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/explosion.htm	0

There are a few slight problems with that theory. First of all the evidence fits perfectly with that book you speak of. If predicts that all creatures came about suddenly and completely formed. This is all we have ever observed. The earliest creatures -according to your theories dating- had incredibly formed eyes etc. and no ancestors among the fossils   It also predicts that animals will produce the same kind of animals , this is all that has ever in the history of the world been observed.   +It predicts the heavens will show a perfect order and can be used for signs and for seasons and for days and for years. That is all that has ever been observed in the history of the world.   It predicts that recorded human history will be less that 10k years. That is what we observe.   It predicts that man has always been intelligent and ancient language and buildings confirm this.   It predicts that billions of fossils will be found in rock laid down by water all over the world, this we have observed.   It predicts there will be pathways in the sea, this is so.   It predicts that the heating of the air will create wind and this is so.   It predicts that the sea is the source of rain and it is so.   It predicted 800 years in advance that the Messiah the King would ride in to erusalem on a donkey to the exact day . That He would be crucified and his side pierced with a spear and cry out My God , My God why has thou forsaken me ?and it was so. It was predicted the ones who crucified him would cast lots for his garments and they did. That three days later He would rise from the dead and He did.   That DNA mutates does not prove anything other that it mutates. It is almost always harrmul or fatal and has never been observed to change one kind of an animal into another.   That the species that adapt to their environment survive and those that don't die is a self evident truth not evidence. About as intellectually stimulating as saying most things who fail to survive die.   Fossils exist. Now that is a brilliant statement. Why not say , water exist , or sand is?   All dating methods are based on circular logic. If the date agrees with the theory it is correct , if not it must be contaminated. It is based on an assumtion of the quantity of some radioactive substance in a material at some time in the past and how much has decayed when compared to the rate of decay gives us a date. Fortunately we already knew the earth was very old or evolution could not have occured. We know how old fossils are because of the rocks they are in and how old the rocks are by the fossils in the rocks. If the 2 are in the wrong place then we know there was an overthrust which is basically a miracle from God which is allowed because evolution needs it.   Life forms in the millions so therefore it must has started out as a random bunch of chemicals that created itself on a planet that created itself and evolved into the millions we see now. Another brilliant deduction. You are on a roll.   Believe our eyes. Oh you must mean all those times you are walking down the beach and trip all over the lobe finned fish coming on shore for the first time. Or the thousands of times we have seen a lizard with half a wing or a beaver giving birth to an armadillo. Yes , seeing is believing.   You present a brilliant argument. How could anyone argue with your brand of logic? That would be senseless.	1

Oh. You just lost me. The fact is, Jesus warned his followers that they would be persecuted for his sake. Read Matthew 10:5-42, if you care for the full text. Basically he told them they would be beaten, thrown in prison, crucified, and put to death if they followed him. And that is exactly what happened to the disciples and all those who gave a witness for Christ as Lord and Savior.   The various Roman emperors in those years of the early church sought to kill every Christian they could find, men, women, and children. Christians were crucified by the thousands, covered in pitch, and sit afire to provide light for the emporer's lavish garden parties. They were killed in the arena by wild animals and tortured to death in numerous ways. They were called martyrs, which now means one who dies for a cause. The word is Greek and means â€œwitnessâ€�.

In spite of everything that the emperor did, they could not kill the Christians fast enough. More were believing in Christ every day, and eventually even the Roman emperor himself became a Christian and Christianity was embraced and sanctioned.	0

A soul has a consciences, it can be emotionally moved from different states of being. This is how the Bible can say ones soul is moved; saddened; joyous. Etc.   I think therefore I am.

Hamburger does not have a soul, it is dead meat. People eat brains and all the pieces of an animal. No soul. The soul is consciences.

If you?re on a machine and a doctor determines your brain is dead, the soul is not there. The body could see hell or heaven and there is no emotional effect. No soul for that.   Read the Bible.

Well, at some point they are sentient beings(surely you agree), that's the point that the fetus becomes a person in my opinion. Before that it's not really too bad. I don't have a problem with people "having sex in an improper way" or choosing to "screw each other how they would like to screw each other". I do have a problem with people creating a feeling being and then killing it, as is the case when fetuses become sentient and are aborted. You also say that it is my opinion, which it is, but it is also your opinion. You have said that women who have abortion because they arn't responsible are making bad decisions.   First off, it's not punishment, it's taking responsibility for your actions. I have addressed the men, this is what I'm talking about, it was in my last post. Are you really reading the my posts? I said "They(men) should have to raise the child also as they are equally to blame". If I could take some of the birthing pain from women and give it to mwn, I would. The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain, yet some do not protect themselves against it. Why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account? They accepted the risk when the didn't try to protect against it.   Yeah, like the one that I addressed the men in, right?   I have never said that we should punish 12 year old orphans. Show me where I said that. I said that the parents should help raise the child if they have the means. Would that put a slight damper on the 12 year olds social life? Probably, but she will be an adult soon enough and she should take some responsibility for her actions. The father should have to do the same. Why do you admit that the actions of the 25 year old are tragic but you don't want her to take responsibility?   How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself? I know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest. Also, what do you mean by "less fortunate? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would. Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor? No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough. She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined.   I don't want to do anything as far as laws are concerned. I would recommend that she and the father raise the child, but sadly that may not happen. I will just continue to have pity for all of the irresponsible "lovers" out there.	1

Probably, simply she testament comprise associate in nursing adult soon enough and she should take some responsibleness for her actions. The father should suffer to set the same. Why coiffure you allow that the actions of the 25 year old ar tragic simply you don't want her to take responsibility? How does represent poor limit your responsibleness to protect yourself? one know a poor cleaning woman who take in ten shaver equitable desire that one day she would find a man that would beryllium willing to help promote the rest.

To a small extent, this happens already. Oftentimes (21.3%, U.S.), a woman decides to have and abortion because she cannot afford a baby (from here, source). This is in effect removing members of society who are non-productive (babies produce virtually nothing useful until they mature by about 10 years). And poor families are less productive, since they are often on welfare.   Granted, this is a rather harsh perspective, but the effect is the same: In the U.S., there are about (21.3% X 1.31 million) 280,000 less people every year who would have likely grown up in a poor home (assuming the child wouldn't have been adopted). Forced contraception/abortion is seen as an effective way of solving poverty in some parts of the world...	0

Your use of language is rather colourful here (lying propagandist!) and smacks of hyperbole. What is being critisised here is bad application of the scientific method in relation to National Geographic's articles on the nature of relationship between birds and dinosaurs. I think Olsen makes some very pertinent points, but at no stage is he saying that evolution does not occur or the possibility that there is no link between any theropods and birds ever.   What he correctly draws attention to is poor peer review and less than conclusive evidence to support the hypothesis of the article's author. In turn this is a stinging criticism of the NG given its high profile, reputation and claim to being a leading forum for the presentation of science in a popular format.	1

As pointed out, with a different physics, chemistry and biology, the universe as we know it wouldn't exist. What is really damaging to the concept of creationism as truth is a list of what we should expect if a flood had occurred under the same laws of science that are in operation today. One problem with creationism (I know, you want to ignore the problems) is that they constantly fall back on miracle in order to do a reset of reality in order to circumvent reality when creationism bumps into scientifically impossible events.   I don't mean to rain on the parade, but with all that said, it has been done. There is a list of 28 items, originally compiled by Jim Moore, that we should find if the flood happened as per the Bible. Not even miracles can solve these.

So where in there does Behe say that brute luck is actually impossible? Nowhere.   Where in there does Behe say that brute luck can be absolutely and definitively ruled out, 100%. Nowhere.   As I originally said, â€œWe can find such an explanation wanting or unsatisfying, but being highly unlikely is not the same as proving it could not happen.â€� This is quite in line with Behe's statements in his book. Further, PROVING it IMPOSSIBLE is what you would have had to have done to PROVE that evolution is false. Behe says it can't be proven impossible: that it can't be completely refuted.   (And quite frankly, most of us would agree that claiming that an IC system - or multiple IC systems - arose by multiple simultaneous mutations is in no way comparable to claiming that â€œthe word luckily popped into existence yesterday with all the features it now has.â€� Behe's not being fully honest here.)   What I quoted Behe saying is exactly what he said and is his position on the matter. I have NOT misrepresented Behe's position on this.   Now, a charge of wrongdoing is discarded unless the party making the accusation can fully support his charge: burden of proof falls upon the accuser, not the accused. You've failed to support your charge, so I prevail.   Now, if you want to continue pushing your charge of wrongdoing on my part, you need to show where, in Behe's â€œDarwin's Black Boxâ€�, he goes on to show that brute luck is actually impossible: where Behe shows that brute luck can be absolutely and definitively ruled out, 100%. Until you do, you have failed to rebut my counter to your statements, and, I am also cleared of your false charges.   PS: The only one playing around with context here is YOU! The context of my statements was that you claimed to have PROVEN EVOLUTION false, and I pointed out that:   (1) in order for you to have succeeded, one of several things you would have to do (but didn't) is to DISPROVE multiple, simultaneous mutations (brute luck)   and   (2) Behe himself says that multiple, simultaneous mutations CANNOT be absolutely ruled out.   Try to keep the context, okay.	0

Well then this doesn't answer my question.   If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people).

Because guns are the best method available on the market. Settling for second best when you could have the best is just stupid.   Better locks?

I think I hear a bell dinging!! Ding! Ding! Let the round begin. Your giving me the invite, and I'm willing to take it.   Now I'm not going to make any comments on your ex, or whatever he is to you. Because I don't know him enough to assume anything about him. But I will make general statements on the effects of gay marriages on children.   I have seen so many documents, on teens the are confused about their sexual orintation, because of living i the house with their gay parents. On girl wondered if she was gay because her mother was with another woman. She felt that was normal behavior. And started to concider being with girls herself.

So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick, that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs, but that isn't a miracle that can be attributed to God, but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ?   So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true, then you must admit that something supernatural still happened, it's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name.   Now mind you, I totally reject that, as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking, that I have no supernatural powers within me. And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural, and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened.   But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that cannot be denied. And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend. Because you see, I am a sinner and completely unworthy to be in Gods presence at all, yet He has lived within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since I accepted Jesus as my Savior in August of 1975. And if you want to believe me, 2 of the Angelic interventions I experienced happened before I was even saved in August of 75. So as it is written, before the foundation of the World, God Knew me. And while I was yet in the womb, He knew me. And while I was in the womb, He knew the number of hairs on my head. So also, even before I accepted Jesus and was born again, my Father in Heaven knew me, loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation.   This is why I'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief. If I denied Jesus and Gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences I have had, I would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive Gods Grace and Love as I have. I have prophesied, spoken in the language of the Angels, been supernaturally saved from drowning, been saved from a violent attack which may have led to my murder as I had 5000 in cash on me at the time. But my Guardian Angel intervened and ran the muggers off and they never found the money. That was just one of the interventions and all I did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind, "Lord Jesus, help me". Nothing I did stopped the attack, nor could it have as these people had murder in their eyes. I had never seen such cold blooded hatred in any persons eyes before as was in this one guy. And yet within seconds I saw that rage in his eyes turn to abject terror as he looked past me, then he said to me, the next time I'll kill you and they ran away like total cowards. When I turned around to see who had scared them so much and looked exactly where they looked when they looked over my shoulder, you know what i saw ? Absolutely nothing. There was nobody there at all, no human anyway.	0

Yes Chrstians should be disarmed so the "moral" atheists, humanists, pagans who crucified people should rule over us . . . that would give everyone a warm fuzy feeling inside.

And do you desire not to fear the authority? Do the good, and you will have praise from it; 4 for it is a servant of God to you for the good. But if you practice evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to the one practicing evil. 5 Because of this, it is necessary to be subject, not only on account of wrath, but also on account of conscience. 6 For on this account you also pay taxes, for they are ministers of God, always giving attention to this very thing. 7 Then give to all their dues: to the one due tax, the tax; to the one due tribute, the tribute; to the one due fear, the fear; to the one due honor, the honor.   Luke 11: 21 When the strong one, having been armed, guards his dwelling, his goods are in peace. 22 But as soon as one stronger than he comes, he overcomes him; he takes away his armor on which he relied, and deals out his arms.

The Sun was crucial in the evolution of most life on the planet, but it may not have been the main cause of the very beginning of life. There are hypotheses that energy necessary, chemical catalysts available, Carbon, Nitrogen, Hydrogen, but not Oxygen apart from being part of the Water molecule. There are tectonic activated hot springs and chimneys in the deep sea. There is an availability of Sulfur, heat energy, and the triggering of a Sulphur based metabolism. It was internal energy from up welling and down welling of hot magma which in turn was fuelled by core radioactivity. Some even speculate that the very centre of the core may be pure Uranium.   However, there is no need to debate the Second Law of Thermodynamics. It is a ruse by Magical Creationists who deliberately and in my opinion deceptively make Earth a closed entropy system.

Yes, that's all true, and it makes complete sense. But in doing this, the Court may have created a situation where plaintiffs can argue that California is denying people the equal protection of the laws, by allowing some people to be married to same-sex spouses and not allowing other people to be so married. If that is the argument that the plaintiffs make in their federal lawsuit, this could be interesting. The courts might have to interpret whether allowing some people to be married and not allowing other people to be married violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. constitution. And then they might have to decide whether this means that all same-sex couples must have the right to marry, because some of them can be legally married. In other words, this situation may be an opportunity, because no one can argue that this is a case of apples and oranges of same-sex couples being different from opposite-sex couples. Now you have same-sex couples who are legally married and same-sex couples who cannot be legally married in the same state, which can be argued to be denial of equal protection of the laws.

You are distorting my view. I certainly do not think that I am "god" or that everyone has to revolve around my standard. However, I do think that morality has to have a rational basis behind it. This is my particular rational basis.   My moral code certainly isn't my own invention but is based on the moral codes which I have often heard expressed by others, as well as the moral code of the German philosopher Kant (often referenced in secular moral discussions). Most people from childhood are taught morals at least partly from the same points of view I use. After all, how often have you heard the phrase "How would YOU like it if that happenned to you?" or something similar. That is essentially the same as my basis of morality. It seems to be very common. Even many religions use a similar basic appoach - "Do unto others...". Of course, we all differ enough in our psychology that we might have some differences in how we would expect to be treated by others. So, this approach that I present would not lead to the same result in all people. Also, this approach depends on the capabilities of the person to see the big picture and to be able to fully see things from the other person's point of view. Since we are imperfect in these skills, it certainly helps to have moral discussions, moral mentors, etc. who can enlighten us in various situations. It is not a perfect method but at least it is not arbitrary since it is based on reason. Note that the famous German philosopher Kant gave a similar secular moral code in his Categorical Imperative: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law".   Your view doesn't seem to be based on reason but on a blind trust in a religious authority that tells you that a particular set of rules is right and must not be questioned. For those of us who do not hold the same beliefs as you, those rules often seem quite arbitrary. Sometimes some of the reasons behind those rules are illucidated, often not. Sometimes the rules are the same as those derived by secular reasoning, sometimes not.   Personally, I would prefer an imperfect moral code that at least is based on reason and is refineable to one that is immovable and based on arbitrary standards.   On a last note, there certainly could be moral codes that are based neither on religion nor on some version of the moral code which I have presented. If so, I would be quite interested in hearing them.	0

I'm not sure what the source of the bias would be. Do you mean that it is somehow prejudicial to link ID with creationism, because, somehow ID is scientific while creationism isn't?

In fact, it was clearly demonstrated that the motivation for ID is an effort to disguise the fact that it is nothing more than creationism without the mention of god.

Color is a function of the wavelength of light. Thus, quantum considerations aside, there are a nigh infinite number of colors. Humans, of course, can only see a subset of those colors, ranging from about 400 to 700 nanometers. In particular, our eyes have cells "tuned" to three ranges of wavelengths; blue, red, and green. You could think of those as short, medium, and long wavelengths. By extrapolating from the relativity intensities from the particular cells we can "figure out" what wavelength is entering our eyes.   http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tut...perception.htm   Does this dispell your confusion?   Edit:   And just to address one other point, scientists are well aware of the limitations of the human eye. That's why, when exact determination of color is important, machines that can read precise wavelengths are used, rather than relying on the known to be limited instrument which is the human eye.	1

And what of when you go by some moral standard to determine what is right and wrong in other peoples' lives as well? What? you don't do that? Bull. You can't tell me you never have an opinion or judgment on anything anyone else does. But by your logic, that would be imposing on them.   Sorry, that dog just doesn't hunt. Everyone has some basis for the views they have about they way they think society would be best. There's no law that says people can't participate in that process with religion or anything else as their moral basis.

Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work.   And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population.	0

Whether or not the 2nd Amendment was written to provide for the protection of the States from a foreign invasion, or border dispute, or Civil War, it is clear that the objective of the 2nd Amendment is to address the basic provisions and control required to form a militia reporting to the President.   One of the provisions to form a militia is explicitly stated in the   2nd Amendment as the unrestricted Right of the individual to own guns.   At that time in our history, when a militia was formed, it was expected that individuals would bring their own gun(s) to the militia. That provision is THE IMPLICIT PURPOSE of the Right of the individual to own guns.   Within the 2nd Amendment, there are NO OTHER IMPLICIT, NOR EXPLICIT purposes pertaining to the unrestricted Right of the individual to own gun(s).   In other words, the 2nd Amendment does NOT IMPLICITLY, NOR EXPLICITLY suggest or expand its purpose beyond what it required for a militia, and the control of a militia.   The 2nd Amendment does NOT provide an individual the Right to own gun(s) for the PURPOSE OF providing for: food, self-defense, target practice, a hobby as a collector, or fun..   Therefore, ANY OTHER PURPOSE OR REASON for the possession of guns that has been attributed to rights under the 2nd Amendment is based entirely upon thoughts and purposes that were NOT IN THE MINDS OF the Founding Fathers when the 2nd Amendment was written.   The Founding Fathers knew many people required guns to provide for food, income, and home-defense. Yet, the Founding Fathers did not separate the purpose of the unrestricted Right of individuals to own guns for a militia, from the SOLE PURPOSE of owning guns for the creation of a militia.   The Founding Fathers did not write the 2nd Amendment in a manner that   would even suggest that the Right of an individual to own guns had purposes beyond a militia, that would provide for: food, self-defense, target practice, a hobby as a collector, or fun..   We may therefore conclude that, any reason or purpose for an individual owning a gun, OTHER THAN for a militia, is not provided for under the 2nd Amendment, and that current gun laws for private ownership of guns is mistaken.   Justifications or reasons to provide individuals with a Right to own guns for a purpose or reason other than a militia, would have to be based on some Amendment, other than the 2nd Amendment, to determine if any such Right exists for individual gun ownership exists.   That the Founding Fathers did not write all Amendments with the explicit and specific Rights of individuals for every condition and circumstance is self-explanatory, as the size of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution would be enormous, and the Founding Fathers would still be busy writing the Bill of Rights and a Constitution if that was the case.   However, the Founding Fathers were very careful in their use of words and phrases, and in the logical composition of a Constitution, and that they decided not to specify other purposes exist that justify individual gun ownership, beyond a militia, in the 2nd Amendment. That decision would appear to be intentional.   Although it might ideal to understand all that the Founding Fathers had in mind, when the Constitution was written, it must also be understood   and concluded that what was the basis for a rational giving the Founding Fathers reasons to create an Amendment, and chose specific terms, phrases, and specifics, may not exist today, nor even be of any importance.   For example, individuals need not carry guns from their home to where our troops will gather. Today?s ?militia? provides for the a militia?s need, and an individual?s need for guns. What the Founding Fathers once wrote with respect to an individual possessing a gun for the purpose of a militia and the remainder of the 2nd Amendment requires revision or elimination.	0

Sure you do . Because like any reprobate, what is wrong, is right to you; and what is right, is wrong to you. So of course you consider anything i believe to be wrong. But just so my original statement isn't lost to your attack, here it is again so it can be clearly interpreted without your tainted condemnation.   Archangel The ugly reality of life in America today regarding the secular humanist Left is that they support free speech as long as you agree with them. If you disagree with them, you are branded as a religious zealot who's determined to take their rights away. What they don't want you to ever realize is that it is they who are tearing at the traditions and customs that America was built upon and gained us the respect of the World at large.

Well, the slavery analogy for gay rights is past it's applicability at this point--one was a property issue (also rooted in deep prejudice), the other is a morality issue. Many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and NOT prejudice. The same can't be said for slavery. There are many ways that the analogy doesn't work and that's just one of them. In fact, it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage. After all, the plantation owners were the ones really fighting for ill-conceived rights--rights that they shouldn't have had.	0

I believe that's true, and as a "believer" (creationist), here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says "He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters". It is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from Jesus, and would seek to be "with" him, while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves "not with" him.

Miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion, and that it shouldn't be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist.	0

Well, I have heard people on the pro-gun side say that most defensive gun uses don't involve firing even one round. So limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime. So why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this? When semi-automatic rifles were banned in Australia, hunters welcomed the law. They saw it as a challenge because it takes greater skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle. Not so in America where some gun owners like to use guns that could take down planes to shoot small animals.	0

No. We don't agree. For one thing your faith isn't a theory. Creation as described in Genesis is a myth, in fact, two myths. Furthermore, a scientific theory doesn't mean "wild guess with no foundation". That seems to be what you want the word to mean.

The germ theory of disease, the theory of gravitation, the heliocentric theory, tectonic theory, atomic theory.   Moreover, you are wrong that science cannot observe actual evolution of life.

You supplied that because it is foolish to claim otherwise. That's what I mean when I say that you reject parts of the Bible that you see as foolish.

Monty babbles:   Again Monty has shown that he doesn't bother to learn what he is talking about before he speaks. It is not true that science has "found" the mitochondrial Eve, nor is it true that it shows that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human population. Both ideas are ridiculous in the extreme. The mitochondrial (note spelling monty) Eve is a mathematical concept. If the estimates of the mutation rate of mitochondrial DNA are correct, then she lived about 200,000 years ago or so.   And of course, the variation in human populations is carried by the nuclear DNA, not the mitochondria. High school biology students know this. And, of course, recent analysis has shown that every gene in the human genome has an average of 14 alleles. Since a single person can carry only two alleles of any gene, monty's assertion becomes pure nonsense.   Hank says:   Really? When and by whom? I wasn't even aware that it was an hypothesis but simply a mathematical concept derived from the mutation rate of the mitochondrial DNA. Possibly the time has been adjusted due to differing estimates of the mutatiion rate, but the concept is valid.   Here is some information. Monty, I would recommend that you read the books suggested so that you might gain some understanding of what you are discussing. You continue to make yourself look foolish. River out of Eden is a good, basic introduction to the main concepts of evolutionary biology.   For information on Mitochondrial Eve see What, if anything, is a Mitochondrial Eve?	0

The definition of manslaughter is when one's actions, which end up killing someone, display a reckless disregard for the dangers of the situation. That's not a proper legal definition, but it'll do.   Now, you want to argue that pro-lifers would be forced into the counterintuitive conclusion that ALL miscarriage is manslaughter, and thus their position is ridiculous. I'm saying that they would only be forced to admit that a very small portion of miscarriage is manslaughter, and a portion that they would probably be willing to make a case for.   I'm not saying "miscarriage is not manslaughter," but only "miscarriage is not always manslaughter." For example, if a woman took perfectly good care of herself and did nothing dangerous, but had a miscarriage anyway, she would obviously not have committed manslaughter. If a woman had one drink with dinner, but she was carrying a very unhealthy fetus and it died, then she would not have committed manslaughter, because that was not reckless. I pointed out the "you-shouldn't-be-drinking-and-having-unprotected-sex" argument as a position somebody might hold, but I think that it would probably be judged as unrepresentative of the definition of manslaughter.   So obviously, miscarriage cannot be manslaughter in the sense of "every instance of A is an instance of B."	0

Really? I wasn't aware that the definition had changed. I do know that a definition was formulated as part of the modern synthesis back in the 1930s and 40s. That is the definition I learned some decades ago, it is the one I have always used, and it is the one that I still find in modern biology texts. It is also the one that all biologists that I know use, and of course the meaning definition of what evolutionary biologists mean when they talk about evolution should be determined by evolutionary biologists themselves. It seems kind of an empty exercise to invent a definition that isn't what evolutionary biologists mean and then argue against it in an effort to disprove evolution.   Let me put it this way, do you think that it would be acceptable in a discussion of Christianity if I were allowed to invent my own definition of what a Christian means when he talks about salvation?

You know what? You're starting to remind me an awful lot of reverend Jackson and reverend Phlaeger (the one who said they were going to kill anyone that didn't support their ideas of gun control). The claimed that a gun shop owner was intentionally violating the laws of Chicago and selling all kinds of weapons to gang members, simply by being one mile outside of the Chicago city limits.   Your entire argument is that since there are firearms dealers within a certain distance to the Mexico/America border, then they must obviously be outfitting the mexican drug cartels.   You've hung yourself with this article you just posted, and I'm gonna explain why. The ATF has said there are 6,700 licensed dealers along the border, meaning they know exactly where they are. So why exactly isn't the ATF going in there and breaking them up for their illegal activities? After all if close proximity is an unquestionable sign of guilt, then the ATF must know that these guys are equipping mexican drug cartels with fully automatic machine guns (the kinds that the American people can't ever get) and grenades and rocket launchers, and maybe even the odd nuclear warhead.   The ATF shut down Red's Trading Shop on matters as insignificant as typos. So why aren't they going in and shutting down these rogue dealers if they're doing anything wrong? It's illegal to own an automatic weapon of any sort without a federal tax stamp, and it's not possible for civilians to own post-'86 model automatic weapons, so why isn't the ATF doing something about it if they're breaking the laws?   Seriously Aussie, what is it, is the ATF saying "We know they're breaking the laws, but they're not doing anything illegal we can bust them on"?	1

Well, the short version is that shortly after the big bang, the universe was filled by a hot quark plasma. As it expanded and cooled, the process of nucleosynthesis produced the primordial elemental abundance, primarily hydrogen, with some deutirium, helium, and lithium. The physics is well understood, and verified by observation. Quantifying uncertainties in primordial nucleosynthesis without Monte Carlo simulations   At roughly a billion years of age, stars and galaxies formed, some fraction of the stars that formed were massive supergiants, that burned up their hydrogen into other elements, up to the atomic number of iron. This occurred at a tremendous rate and in a few more billion years, these stars went supernova and exploded. Prior to going supernova, these stars go through a phase where the outer layers of the star are shed, providing ways to transport the lighter elements away from the star. You can see this in the following link:   Hubble Chemically Analyzes the Ring around Supernova 1987A   The trememdous radiation of the supernova permits the formation of elements with atomic numbers higher than iron. The force of these explosions scattered the newly created elements, creating vast gas and dust clouds. Eventually, the shockwave of another explosion initiated the collapse of one of these clouds, and the spinning hydrogen cloud begins to heat , eventually initiating nuclear fusion, and becoming our sun. As the sun began to increase it's heat output, the volatile remains of the accretion disk are driven away from the inner portion of the solar system, leaving mostly heavy elments. Comets bombarded the inner solar system, transporting water, carbon, and amino acids to the newly forming earth, making dirt.   In short, a truely wonderful creation.	1

Well is this serious science or is this ring-around-the-rosie on Sesame Street?   Am I just supposed to play make-believe and/or use my imagination? I can do that -- for instance, when I play with my kids, I'm real good at playing the role of "Ken" when we imagine that "Barbie goes to the beach" Surely the fossil record shows gradualism or not.   I bought a book a while back at a half-price bookstore from Niles Eldredge. He says the following about gradualism:   ----------------------------------------   Change in this manner (gradualism) is just not found in the fossil record. pg. 48   Darwin invented the myth that species were not real to convince the world of the nonmyth that evolution had occured. pg. 52   Darwin's prediction that long-term evolutionary change should produce a systematic pattern of gradual, progressive change in the fossil record was faulty. pg. 53   As we have seen in the previous chapter, the usual conception casts evolution as a gradual, steady process of adaptive change. And we have already seen that the fossil record conflicts with that view. pg. 57   We're faced more with a great leap of faith -- that gradual, progressive, adaptive change underlies the general pattern of evolutionary change we see in the rocks -- than any hard evidence. pg. 57   ------------------------------------   I guess I would consider myself more of a PE guy than a gradualist simply because of what the fossils indicate. It seems to me that instead of evolving gradually that animals evolve quickly -- like the spiders on my shed. (do you find it odd that they emerged yellow in the spring?)   It seems butterflies have this same ability.....Evolution sure is amazing!   For instance, Monteiro said, the darker wing patterns that show up in butterflies that emerge in the spring serve to warm up the butterfly faster, whereas butterflies that emerge in the summer have lighter colors.   "Also, many butterflies that emerge in the wet season in the tropics have large, conspicuous marks on their wings that deflect the attacks of predators while the butterflies are actively finding mates and laying eggs, while the dry-season cohorts are very cryptic, trying to blend in with their environment and not attract any attention from predators until the rains arrive again," she said   http://unisci.com/stories/20021/0313021.htm	1
Well follow this serious scientific discipline or constitute this ring-around-the-rosie on Sesame Street? Am I upright supposed to play pretense and/or use my imagination? I can do that -- for instance, when I play with my kids, I'm real good at playing the role of "Ken" when we imagine that "Barbie goes to the beach" certainly the fossil show shows gradualism or not. I bought angstrom book amp piece back at antiophthalmic factor half-price bookstore from Niles Eldredge. He says the following around gradualism: ---------------------------------------- Change inch this manner (gradualism) follow scarce not found inward the fossil record. pg. 48 Darwin invented the myth that metal money were not real to convince the world of the nonmyth that evolution had occured. pg. 52 Darwin's prediction that long-term evolutionary deepen should produce vitamin a systematic pattern of gradual, progressive switch inch the fossil immortalize was faulty. pg. 53 equally we sustain get word inwards the previous chapter, the usual conception swan evolution as vitamin a gradual, steady litigate of adaptive change. And we hold already view that the fossil read conflicts with that view. pg. 57 We're faced more than with vitamin a great leap of religious belief -- that gradual, progressive, adaptive alter underlies the general pattern of evolutionary modification we see atomic number 49 the rocks -- than whatever hard evidence. pg. 57 ------------------------------------ I guess I would consider myself sir thomas more of amp PE guy than vitamin a gradualist but because of what the fossils indicate. It look to pine tree state that instead of evolving gradually that animals evolve quickly -- like the spiders on my shed. (do you find it peculiar that they emerged scandalmongering indiana the spring?) It look flirt own this same ability.....Evolution sure equal amazing! For instance, Monteiro said, the dark wing patterns that show astir atomic number 49 coquet that emerge indiana the recoil serve to warm upward the butterfly faster, whereas dally that emerge inward the summer deliver light colors.

Really? I have argued that God is an epic liar? Can you point out me arguing that at all you EPIC LIAR? Once again you are interpreting what I have said through that sick and unbalanced mind of yours, and then extrapolating that I am now arguing in favor of calling my God an EPIC LIAR. Is it absolutely impossible for you to debate issues while actually responding to what we really say rather than reading into what we say and redefining it to fit your warped and perverse perspective?   I mean, how sick and disturbed must your powers of reason and logic be for you to interpret my argument that Man, because of our linear view of time, is misreading the fact that God placed the stars in space at the same time much more recently than it appears to us to have occurred, that God is then an epic liar? Is God responsible for how we interpret the evidence when we attempt to do it apart from placing Him first and foremost into the equation? Is He the liar? Or are you who think like that deceiving yourselves by ignoring His place in the creation of time and space?   It is just completely beyond you to think from an honest and objective perspective, isn't it obvious child!   But for a more practical answer, imagine this. In the beginning, space was a void which spanned all of eternity. Only one object/energy source encompassed all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other, and that person was my God Yahweh. And in one second or minutes time, he spoke all of the stars that have ever existed, at different intensities and strengths, which causes them to burn out at different times. But he placed them at the very inner and outer limits of time and space at that time. Liken it to a farmer with a hand full of seeds. He pulls back his arm and throws those seeds to the end of the plot of land he is sowing at that time. To the ants on the ground, if they measured the time it would take to reach the farthest seed, it would represent a great distance, but to the farmer it was just one arms throw in time to disperse hundreds of seeds at one time.   Now here we are as finite creatures who can only see time from our linear perspective. Time is plastic. Our linear measure is man made for our convenience only. That you place what we call the measure of so called light years is arbitrary at best. But I am getting too deep for you and this discussion. The point is that our God has the ability to place the stars in every corner of not only what we again, arbitrarily call our universe, but throughout all of time and space.   But to we puny finite humans who have invented telescopes, it appears that these stars we are seeing today are ancient based on the perceived yet arbitrarily arrived at distance you believe they are from us. But since you are unable to even grasp the hugeness of our God, you also fail to appreciate that light years are a measure of distance rather than time. So by that definition alone, it is foolish to equate it with Earth time rather than Gods ability to reach any distant place in time and space and place stars there.	1
Really? I have argued that deity comprise an epic liar? Can you point forbidden me indicate that astatine wholly you epical LIAR?

Now here we embody type a finite creatures who can but get a line time from our linear perspective. clock time constitute plastic. Our linear step constitute man made for our convenience only. That you place what we call the mensuration of so called light up old age comprise arbitrary atomic number 85 best. But I am getting too deep for you and this discussion. The point follow that our supreme being has the ability to place the stars atomic number 49 every corner of not just what we again, indiscriminately call our universe, but throughout wholly of time and space.

But since you exist unable to even grasp the hugeness of our God, you likewise fail to appreciate that illume days constitute axerophthol step of distance rather than time. and then by that definition alone, information technology make up foolish to equalise information technology with Earth time rather than graven image ability to reach any distant place indium time and space and place stars there.	1

Really? The first description is of a Hippo? Here's a picture of a Hippo charlie: http://www.dkimages.com/discover/pre...0/90065521.JPG   Now tell me how this fits the description of the behemoths tail? I quote:   Job 40:15-24 (New International Version)   15 "Look at the behemoth, [a]   which I made along with you   and which feeds on grass like an ox.   16 What strength he has in his loins,   what power in the muscles of his belly!   [b]17 His tail sways like a cedar;   the sinews of his thighs are close-knit.   18 His bones are tubes of bronze,   his limbs like rods of iron.(In Hebrew, this literally reads, â€œhe lets hang his tail like a cedar.â€�)A Cedar is not a tiny insignificant tree as the hippos tail is when compared to other tails on other animals. You insult the intelligence of the ancients to imply that they couldn't either name or describe a hippo by name which as you yourself admit, was a common animal in that part of the world.   As for Leviathan being a crocodile or an alligator, again, are you telling me that their hides are invulnerable to arrows or spears and cannot be punctured at all? Would those animals stand firm and not flee from men who stood up to them with spears, javelins and arrows? Not on your life.   â€œThough the sword reaches him, it cannot avail; nor does spear, dart, or javelin. He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood.	The arrow cannot make him flee; slingstones become like stubble to him. Darts are regarded as straw; he laughs at the threat of javelins.â€�   â€œOn earth there is nothing like him, which is made without fear.â€�   Leviathan â€œplayedâ€� in the â€œgreat and wide seaâ€� (a paraphrase of Psalm 104 verses 25 and 26â€”get the exact sense by reading them yourself).And do you think that the writer who describes this creature is just throwing in the part about smoke, light and fire coming coming forth from its mouth for creative license?   Job 41:18-21   18   By his exhaling a light does shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.   19   Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.   20   Out of his nostrils goes smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.   21   His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.I fully admit that I am incapable of either explaining or proving what this animal was, but I know it isn't any known animal which currently exists. And Isaiah might have given us the answer as to why this animal no longer exists since we know it was invulnerable to human attacks in the ancient world.Isa 27:1	 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that [is] in the sea.	0

The 2020 Global Food Outlook answers this as it says that a greater demand for vegetables will correspond with higher prices of vegetables in developing countries. Many articles acknowledge that starving people cannot afford much of any of the food for sale around them, and a greater demand for meat does not necesarily mean a decrease in demand for vegetables as populations grow globally. Since increasing meat consumption is irrational because it will not feed the poor and it will do even more damage to the environment, again, the solution proposed is to support the initiative for developing nations to become more self-sufficient in growing plant foods for themselves.	0
