Even much faster and stronger men. If anybody takes offense to my point then they need to reevaluate their lives as their are no man that could do anything better than a lady. 1

There are so many different activities you can do in my small town of Wadsworth. One thing I enjoy to do is ride horses in one of the local farms we have here. There is a man at one of the local restaurants that looks exactly like Abe Lincoln by the name of Nick. At the local ice cream shop by the name of Dolce, they have at least 20 different flavors of ice cream and Italian ice. They are oh so delicious. In the wintertime, we love to go sled riding at one of the local hills. The hill we go to is right next to the highway and is at least 50 feet high. Its one of the best hills around to go sled riding at! 0
